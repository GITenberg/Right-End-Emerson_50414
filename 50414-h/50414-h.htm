<small>A TIP TO THE WAITER</small></h2>


<p>A very gaudy red automobile whirled up the
circling drive that led to the white-pillared portico
of the big hotel at Pine Harbor, announced
its approach with a wheezy groan of the horn and
came to a sudden stop before the steps, a stop so
disconcerting to the extreme right-hand occupant
of the single seat that he narrowly escaped a
head-on collision with the wind-shield. Taking
advantage of the impetus that had unseated him,
he flung his legs over the door and alighted on
the well-kept gravel.</p>

<p>“This car may be sort of cranky when it comes
to <em>going</em>, Mac,” he said, “but she sure can <em>stop</em>!”</p>

<p>“Well, she got you here,” chuckled Harley McLeod.
“Give the kid a hand with the suit-cases,
Jimmy. Pile out, Stan, and I’ll take Matilda
around to the garage and give her some oats.
You fellows register, and tell the guy at the desk
that we want one room and no bath; tell him we
had a bath last week. Don’t let him soak you,
either. We’ve got four more days of this foreign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
travel before we get home, and the old sock’s
mighty near empty. Something about twelve
dollars for the crowd will be pretty near right.”</p>

<p>“Fine,” agreed the third member of the trio,
sarcastically, viewing as he spoke the long front
of the building and its general air of hauteur and
expensiveness. “Twelve dollars apiece is likely
to be closer to it. If you want economy, Mac, why
the dickens do you pick out the swellest joints on
the route?”</p>

<p>“Well,” answered McLeod, glancing rearward
to see if the suit-cases had been wrested from their
place, “we don’t seem to have much luck that way,
and that’s a fact. Gee, that place last night pretty
nigh ruined me! You do your best, anyway. All
clear, Jimmy? Let go their heads! Back in a
minute!” The small red car leaped forward impetuously,
dashed down the drive to the road,
swerved precipitately to the right and was lost
to sight—if not to hearing—beyond a hedge.
Stanley Hassell joined Jimmy Austen and together
they followed a small uniformed youth,
laden with three suit-cases, up the steps, across
the wide porch and into the hotel.</p>

<p>It was Stanley who took the pen from the politely
extended hand of the clerk and inscribed the
names of his party on the register. After each
name he added “N. Y. City.” This was less truthful
than convenient, for although he and Harley
McLeod lived in widely separate sections of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
far-stretching metropolis, Jimmy hailed from
Elizabeth, New Jersey. But, as Stanley had explained
soon after the beginning of their two-weeks
tour in Mac’s disguised flivver, “Elizabeth,
N. J.” was too long to write. Besides, he added,
it wouldn’t be long before Elizabeth became a
part of New York, anyway, and there was no harm
in anticipating.</p>

<p>“We’d like a room for three,” announced Stanley
when he had put down the last dot. “With
single beds, if possible, and without a bath. As
reasonable a room as you have, please.”</p>

<p>The clerk, a carefully attired gentleman,
frowned hopelessly. “I’m afraid we haven’t a
room with three single beds,” he said, as he consulted
a book. “I can give you a nice large room
on the front of the house, however. That has a
double bed in it, and I can have a cot put in also.
I’m afraid that’s the best—”</p>

<p>“What’s the price of it?” interrupted Stanley
anxiously.</p>

<p>“How long are you staying?”</p>

<p>“Just overnight.”</p>

<p>“Eight dollars, in that case.”</p>

<p>“For the bunch?” inquired Jimmy eagerly.</p>

<p>The clerk shook his head and smiled again, this
time commiseratingly. “Eight dollars a day
apiece,” he said in his nicely modulated tones.
“Our regular price, gentlemen.”</p>

<p>It was Stanley’s turn to do a little head-shaking.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
“Look here,” he confided earnestly, “you’ve
got us wrong. We weren’t thinking of <em>buying</em> the
room; we just want to <em>rent</em> it. Now, what about
a room on the <em>back</em> of the house? Something
about fifteen dollars for the three of us? We
aren’t crazy about the view, anyway; besides, we
couldn’t see much at night, could we? You just
take another peep into the old book there and talk
reasonable!”</p>

<p>The gentleman seemed inclined to be haughty
for a moment, but Stanley’s smile was captivating
and he went back to the book good-naturedly
enough. “There’s a room on the third floor,” he
announced at last. “It’s rather small, but perhaps
it will do. The rate is sixteen-fifty.”</p>

<p>Stanley mused a moment, mentally dividing sixteen
dollars and fifty cents by three, and then
nodded. “All right,” he agreed. “Guess that’ll
have to do.”</p>

<p>“Front! Show the gentlemen to 87!”</p>

<p>“Say,” broke in Jimmy with very evident anxiety,
“that includes meals, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>This time the clerk smiled quite humanly. “Certainly,”
he replied. “We are on the American
Plan.”</p>

<p>“Idiot!” breathed Stanley as they turned away.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” replied Jimmy doggedly.
“It’s just as well to be sure. Look at the time
they held us up for seven dollars apiece and then
we found we had to pay extra to eat!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>“That was in a city, you chump,” reminded
Stanley. They bade the boy with the luggage
wait a minute, but Harley McLeod came hurrying
in just then and they began the ascent of
the stairs. Harley showed a wrathful countenance.</p>

<p>“Those robbers want three dollars for the car!”
he sputtered.</p>

<p>“Three dollars for the car?” echoed Jimmy.
“Let ’em have it, I say. It’s worth five, maybe,
but three dollars is three dollars, and the room’s
costing us sixteen-fifty—”</p>

<p>“<em>What!</em>” exclaimed Harley, standing stock-still
on the landing. “Sixteen <em>dollars</em>?”</p>

<p>“And fifty cents,” confirmed Jimmy cheerfully.
“The fifty cents is for the food.”</p>

<p>Harley McLeod stared darkly at Stanley.
“You’re a swell little bargainer, you are! Why,
that’s five and a half apiece!”</p>

<p>“Well, what of it?” asked Stanley huffily. “We
had to pay six and a half last night, didn’t we?
Say, if you don’t like the way I do it, why don’t
you do it yourself? If you think you can get better
terms—”</p>

<p>“That includes the meals, Mac,” interrupted
Jimmy soothingly. “I asked the Duke of Argyle,
and he said so.”</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up,” begged Harley. “Gosh, these
summer hotels are regular robber dens! All right,
I’ve still got a few sous left, and when I’m broke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
I’ll borrow from Jimmy. Say, where is this room?
On the roof?”</p>

<p>“Third floor, sir,” answered the bell-boy.
“Nice and cool up here.”</p>

<p>“Ought to be if altitude has anything to do
with temperature,” agreed Harley with sarcasm.
“What time’s dinner, son?”</p>

<p>“Seven, sir, and runs to eight-thirty.”</p>

<p>“And it’s only a bit after five,” groaned Jimmy.
“I’ll tell you one thing, fellows, right now, and
that’s this: When the Earl of Buckminster down
there charged me five-fifty he committed a fatal
error. If I don’t eat five-fifty worth of food at
dinner to-night you fellows can throw me in the
ocean!”</p>

<p>“Not so horrid,” commented Stanley as they
strode after the boy into the apartment. “Small,
but sufficient, eh?”</p>

<p>“Do they think we’re going to sleep three in a
bed?” demanded Harley, aghast.</p>

<p>“They’re going to put in a cot for you,” said
Jimmy comfortingly.</p>

<p>“For me!” Harley viewed him coldly. “How
do you attain that condition, Jimmy? What’s the
matter with your sleeping on the cot?”</p>

<p>Jimmy shook his head. “I don’t rest well on
the things,” he answered. “Maybe Stan had better—”</p>

<p>“We’ll draw lots,” said Stanley. He tossed a
dime to the grinning bell-boy and then pulled three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
strands from the tattered fringe of the straw matting
rug. “Short piece gets the cot. Help yourself,
Mac.”</p>

<p>Stanley himself fell heir to the shortest straw
and good-naturedly accepted his fate. “I’m the
smallest, anyway,” he said. “Let’s wash up and
look the place over. Any one for a swim?”</p>

<p>“I’d like a swim,” said Jimmy, “but it always
gives me a fierce appetite, and I’m hungry enough
right now to chew nails! Let’s sit on the porch
and look wealthy. You don’t get so hungry if
you sit still.”</p>

<p>Some two hours later the three boys were conducted
across a large dining-room by an awe-inspiring
head-waiter and seated at a table set for
four. Jimmy looked approvingly at the crowded
menu and passed it across to Harley. “Let’s not
be choosey,” he suggested. “Let’s start right at
the top and take things as they come.”</p>

<p>“Well, we can’t eat three kinds of soup,” said
Harley.</p>

<p>“I could,” Jimmy replied. “But I’m going to
have some clams first. Which soup is the fillingest?”</p>

<p>A boy of about their own age, which is to say
seventeen or eighteen, began pouring water into
the glasses, which led Jimmy to observe for the
first time that the waiters were all masculine and
youthful, though most of them were older than
their own attendant. Just then Harley’s foot collided<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
painfully with Jimmy’s ankle and the latter
emitted a loud howl of anguish that attracted the
disapproving curiosity of the neighboring diners.</p>

<p>“Shut up, you idiot!” whispered Stanley
severely.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” returned Jimmy aggrievedly,
rubbing the injured ankle under the table,
“but he pretty near killed me with that big hoof
of his! Gee, Mac, what’s the prodigious conception?”</p>

<p>“Sorry,” muttered Harley, his eyes on the
menu. “Do we all want clams? All right, clams
for three, then.” This latter to the waiter at his
elbow.</p>

<p>“Will you order your soup and fish now,
please?” asked the waiter. “It saves time.”</p>

<p>“Sure. Let’s see. I’ll have the cream of celery.
What’s yours, Stan?”</p>

<p>“Same, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Oxen tails for me,” said Jimmy. “And a
large portion of that bluing fish.”</p>

<p>The waiter took himself off and Harley leaned
toward Jimmy with a scowl. “Didn’t you see who
that was, you dumb-bell?”</p>

<p>“See who what was?” asked Jimmy, glancing
around blankly.</p>

<p>“The waiter, of course.”</p>

<p>“No, who was he? Charlie Chaplin?”</p>

<p>“Emerson, one of our fellows. You know him.
A junior, I think.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>Jimmy shook his head. “I don’t know any
Emerson, Mac. You mean the chap that’s waiting
on us is an Alton fellow?”</p>

<p>“Sure! What did you think I kicked you for?”</p>

<p>“I thought you just wanted to show your love
for me. What’s he doing here?”</p>

<p>“Waiting on table,” replied Stanley. “Haven’t
you any eyes?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I mean— Well, it seems a funny
thing for an Alton fellow, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Guess all these waiters are students,” returned
Stanley. “College men, a lot of them. I
suppose Emerson needs the money.”</p>

<p>“Well, yes, he would,” agreed Jimmy readily,
“if he’s staying at this joint. I must have a look
at him. I dare say I know him by sight. What’s
he do?”</p>

<p>Harley shrugged. “Nothing much, I guess.
Seems to me, though, he was playing on the second
team last fall.”</p>

<p>“Football?”</p>

<p>Harley nodded, and Stanley confirmed him.
“Yes, he’s been on the second a couple of years.
You’ll remember him when you see him, Jimmy,
for you must have played with him year before
last.”</p>

<p>“Well, if he isn’t any faster on the field than
he is here,” Jimmy grumbled, “it’s no wonder
he’s never made the first. Do you fellows know
him? I didn’t notice any warm hand-clasps!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, I know him to nod to,” replied Harley,
“but you don’t exactly expect to find your school
fellows waiting on table in a public hotel. I dare
say he doesn’t want to be recognized. Anyway,
he didn’t speak to me.”</p>

<p>“Suppose he thought it was up to you to signal
first,” said Jimmy. “After all, Mac, waiting in a
summer hotel isn’t much different from waiting
at college, and lots of corking chaps have done
that. Here he is now, I guess. Making good time
through a broken field, too! Just missed a tackle
then! If that other fellow had got him it would
have been good-by, clams! Yes, I’ve seen him
lots of times, but I never knew his name.”</p>

<p>While the waiter placed the orders on the table
Jimmy observed him. He was a well-made boy,
slim yet muscular, a fact not entirely hidden by
the ill-fitting waiter’s jacket that he wore. He
had brown eyes, rather quiet seeming eyes, and
brown hair that was very carefully brushed away
from his forehead, and a fairly short nose. On
the whole, Jimmy decided, Emerson, so far as his
appearance went, was a credit to Alton Academy.
That he had recognized the trio was very evident
to the observer, and that he had no intention of
making use of his slight acquaintance with Harley
was equally evident. He spoke only when addressed
and then carefully avoided the speaker’s
eyes. Jimmy didn’t know whether Emerson felt
any embarrassment, but he somehow wished that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
the impressive head waiter had seated them elsewhere.
It was rather jarring to be served in this
fashion by a chap you were likely to meet on the
Green a week or so hence!</p>

<p>But Jimmy soon forgot that, for he was extremely
hungry, the food was excellent, the waiter,
in spite of having two other tables to serve, attended
to their wants in quite professional fashion
and the dinner passed off pleasantly and expeditiously.
Toward the last of it Stanley presented
a problem to them. “Say, fellows, how about
tips?” he asked.</p>

<p>Harley frowned. “I was wondering,” he said.
“Of course these fellows must take tips. I’ll bet
the hotel doesn’t pay them much. But, just the
same, it sort of goes against the grain, Stan.”</p>

<p>“Leave it till morning,” advised Jimmy.
“Then we can slip a dollar under a plate when he
isn’t looking.”</p>

<p>“A dollar!” ejaculated Harley. “Listen to the
millionaire! It’s always been fifty cents for the
bunch so far.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, this is different,” replied Jimmy.
“This guy’s one of us, you see. You can’t be a
piker with one of your own School!”</p>

<p>And so the matter was left, and they moved
from the dining-room rather ponderously and
sighingly seated themselves in three rocking
chairs on the broad veranda and, almost in silence,
watched a huge orange-colored moon arise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
beyond the rim of the quiet ocean. The longest
speech of the ensuing quarter of an hour was
made by Jimmy. “Allowing fifty cents for breakfast
and a dollar for my third of the bed to-night,
I figure that I’ll be just twenty-five cents ahead
of the house when we go our way!”</p>

<p>Later, having decided to play some pool as an
aid to digestion, Jimmy paused as they passed
through the lobby and fixed what he afterwards
explained was an expression of triumphant gloat
on the clerk behind the desk. This expression he
continued until the clerk, happening to glance
toward him, returned his look with one of mingled
surprise and concern. Thereupon Jimmy ceased
gloating and hurried after the others, who, meanwhile,
had reached the billiard room just in time
to secure the last pool table ahead of two disgruntled
elderly plutocrats in dinner-jackets.
These latter gentlemen, grumbling their displeasure,
seated themselves, behind large and expensive
cigars, on a leathern divan and watched the
play of the trio with basilisk stares that interfered
seriously with Stanley’s game. Harley and
Jimmy refused to be intimidated, but after five
games, all won by Harley, they acknowledged defeat
and yielded the table to the besiegers. However,
it was just on nine o’clock then, and, as Stanley
wisely observed, they were paying good money
for that room and so might as well make use of
it. At ten they were fast asleep, as was befitting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
those who had traveled one hundred and eight
miles since morning in Matilda!</p>

<p>Yet it was well after nine o’clock the next day
when they descended for breakfast. They were
unanimous in declaring regretfully that they were
not really hungry, but they managed to do fairly
well with cereal, eggs, steak, hot biscuits and coffee.
Their waiter again attended to them in a
manner that was beyond criticism, and Jimmy acknowledged
a warm admiration for his skill and
dexterity. “Some garsong, if you ask me,” said
Jimmy. “Has everything under perfect control
and hasn’t dropped a plate yet!”</p>

<p>“I feel a bit mean about not speaking to him,”
said Stanley. “After all, he’s one of us, and we
know it, and he knows we know it, and—”</p>

<p>“Yes, and he doesn’t want us to do anything of
the sort,” interrupted Jimmy. “The chap’s incog.
Let us—let us respect his wishes, eh?”</p>

<p>Harley looked relieved. “Jimmy’s right, I
think. Besides, it isn’t as if we were personal
friends. We only know him by sight, as you might
say. Who’s got a dollar?”</p>

<p>Jimmy produced a crumpled bill with less hesitation
than usual and curled it cunningly under
his plate. Then they departed hurriedly before
the waiter returned. Half an hour later Matilda
jumped away on the next lap of her journey, honking
asthmatically as she disappeared from sight.</p>

<p>Russell Emerson, clearing the dishes from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
table lately occupied by his school-mates, discovered
the crumpled dollar bill and frowned at it.
Then the frown vanished and he shrugged his
shoulders and slipped the money philosophically
into his pocket.</p>

<small>PARTNERS CONFER</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Alton Academy commenced its Fall Term on
September 24th that year, and on the afternoon
of the nineteenth Russell Emerson dropped from
the train at Alton Station, a battered valise in
hand, and, disregarding the cordial invitations of
carriage and taxi drivers, set forth on foot. It
appears to be a New England custom to locate the
railroad station as far as possible from the center
of the town, and Alton had made no departure
from custom. A good half-mile intervened between
station and business center, and a second
half-mile between the heart of the town and Alton
Academy. There had been a time when Alton and
Alton Station had been two quite distinct settlements,
but now the town had followed the route of
the trolley and the two were slenderly connected
by a line of small dwellings, small shops and, occasionally,
a small factory. Russell followed the
trolley tracks and, although presently a car came
rattling and whisking toward him from the direction
of the station, continued on foot, the valise
growing heavier as the stores became more important
and more prosperous in appearance. But
the boy rested frequently, always before one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
little stores, and at such times the valise was set
down beside him on the pavement while his gaze
roved from door to window and when possible
penetrated past the usually unattractive display
of goods into the further dim recesses of the building.
Oddly, as it would seem, his pauses were
longer and his interest greater when the window
was empty of goods and a placard announced the
premises for rent. Indeed, on three occasions he
crossed the street to peer up at and into tenantless
stores, and on two occasions he jotted down
memoranda on the back of an envelope ere he took
up his burden and went on.</p>

<p>Reaching the busier and more populous part of
Alton, he turned to the left, past the town’s single
department store, and halted under a sign which
read: “Hartford House—Gentlemen Only—One
Flight.” Russell pushed open the door and
climbed the stairs. The office was at the left of
the landing, a clean, sun-filled room through
whose broad windows one might look down on the
traffic of the street or watch, if one cared to, the
casements across the way, beyond which a tailor,
a Painless Dentist and a manufacturing jeweler
plied their trades. At the desk, presided over by
an elderly man with abundant gray whiskers, Russell
set his name down in an ink-smeared register,
paid the sum of seventy-five cents and was presented
with a key.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>“Eighteen,” said the clerk wheezily. “One
flight, turn to the left. Thank you.”</p>

<p>Acting as his own bell-boy, Russell took himself
and his luggage to the second floor, found the door
numbered 18 and took possession of a very small,
barely furnished room which had, nevertheless,
the merit of cleanliness. He ran the shade up,
opened the window and found himself looking
down on the roof of the Imperial Steam Laundry,
as a bold inscription painted on the corrugated
iron roof informed him. Beyond the laundry were
the brick backs of several office buildings.</p>

<p>“Not much of a view,” murmured Russell tolerantly,
“but plenty of air. Now let’s see.” He
stripped off his coat and placed it, with a somewhat
yellowed straw hat, on the narrow bed.
Then, rolling up his sleeves, he poured water into
the chipped basin and washed face and hands.
That done, he dried on a wispy towel and opened
his valise. From it he extracted a thin bundle of
papers held together by an elastic band, placed
a chair before the window and seated himself,
lodging his feet comfortably on the ledge. For the
next ten minutes he was busy looking through the
contents of the bundle. That completed, he
brought forth a fountain pen from a pocket and
began to figure thoughtfully on the back of one
of the papers.</p>

<p>“Eighty-eight, sixty in bank,” he muttered as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
he set down that sum. “Check for one hundred
and twenty-five. Fifteen and—” He paused and
counted the contents of a small leather purse.
“Fifteen and seventy-four. It’ll cost me three
dollars for my room here for four days and, say,
four dollars for meals. That’s seven dollars.
Then there’ll be incidentals. Guess I’ll say ten
altogether. Ten, seventy-four rather. That
leaves five. Now then. Naught, six, eight and
one to carry, one—two hundred and eighteen dollars
and sixty cents.”</p>

<p>He gazed for a long minute at the result of his
figuring and finally shook his head. “That isn’t
nearly enough,” he sighed. “Maybe, though,
Stick can do better than he thought he could. If
he can put in two hundred more I guess we can
manage.” He looked at his watch. “Ought to be
here in an hour. Guess I’ll go out and have a
look around before he gets here.”</p>

<p>He put his coat on again and took his hat and
sallied forth, stopping at the office long enough to
leave his key and to inform the clerk that he would
be back at five o’clock, in case any one should inquire
for him. Then for the better part of an
hour he roamed the streets in that portion of
Alton which lay between the Hartford House and
the Academy, specializing on the side streets but
not neglecting such important arteries of traffic
and avenues of trade as Meadow and West and
State streets. He was back at a minute or two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
before five and had made himself comfortable in
one of the six wooden armchairs that stood empty
in a row before the windows when feet echoed
on the stairway, the office door was pushed open
and a very tall, very thin youth appeared. He
carried a suit-case, an overcoat and an umbrella,
all of which, perceiving Russell across the room,
he dumped on the desk before stepping to meet
him.</p>

<p>“Hello, Rus,” he greeted. “How long have you
been here? Have you got a room? Do I bunk
in with you, or—”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to get one of your own,” replied
Russell as they shook hands. “Mine’s just a single
one. Guess they all are. How are you, Stick?
Haven’t fattened up much this summer.”</p>

<p>“I’m very well, thanks. Wait till I register and
we’ll go up and have a talk. Got your letter about
ten minutes before I left. Thought you were dead
or something.”</p>

<p>In a room very similar to that assigned to
Russell, the two seated themselves, George Patterson
on the bed and Russell on the single chair.
Stick, as he was called, was a boy of Russell’s own
age, which was seventeen, but looked fully a year
older. He came from St. Albans, Vermont, according
to the school catalogue, and the catalogue was
quite infallible on such subjects, but before that
Stick had lived—in fact had been born—in Toronto,
and there was much more of the Canadian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
than the Yankee in him. He was extremely tall
and extremely thin, with high cheek bones, a good
deal of color, very dark brown hair that curled,
gray eyes, a generous nose and a rather large
mouth. You couldn’t call him handsome, but he
looked particularly healthy and clean and wholesome.
One of the things that Russell liked most
about him was his appearance of having just
stepped out of a bath, and even now, after a long
train journey, that appearance persisted. The
two were room-mates in Upton Hall. They had
been thrown together quite by accident the preceding
fall and had not yet regretted the fact; which,
I think, speaks well for each of them.</p>

<p>Stick wasn’t an awfully brilliant chap. In fact,
there were some who declared that he was rather
a bore. But Russell was used to him, and he had
long since decided that an even temper and similar
attributes were preferable in a room-mate to mere
conversational scintillations. Stick had rather a
peculiar sense of humor, or, perhaps, lack of
humor. He adored a practical joke when it was
on some one else, but saw no fun in such a joke
played on himself. As a fair sample of his ideal
in the way of a funny story it may be stated that
his favorite was a rather long and ponderous tale
about a London window-washer who fell from the
sixth story of a building and landed on a
“bobby.” To Stick there was something irresistibly
appealing to his sense of humor in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
fact that the policeman was killed and the window-washer
wasn’t! But Stick was a fellow who wore
remarkably well, and, after all, that’s a fine quality
in a room-mate.</p>

<p>“Well, I brought the money,” he announced
after a few exchanges of remarks anent the past
vacation.</p>

<p>“How much?” asked Russell anxiously.</p>

<p>“A hundred and twenty-five.”</p>

<p>“A hundred and twent— But, Stick, you said
it would be a hundred and fifty at least!”</p>

<p>“I didn’t say it positively,” disclaimed the
other. “I did think I could put in that much, Rus,
but—well, I just can’t do it.” Then, after a short
pause, he added in a desire to be strictly truthful:
“I mean, I don’t think I ought to, Rus. Of course,
it’s my money, and all that, but father doesn’t
think very well of the idea, and if he needed money
some time he’d expect me to let him have a little,
and if I put it all into this I won’t have any left.
You see, we don’t know for certain that this
thing’s going to be a go. I hope it will be, for I’d
hate to lose that money, but there’s nothing sure
about it, is there?”</p>

<p>Russell shook his head. “No, nothing’s sure
until it’s happened, Stick, but this thing is bound
to go all right. Gee, it’s just got to!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” Stick agreed without much enthusiasm,
“but things don’t always succeed because
some one says they’ve got to.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>Russell sighed. “I wish your grandmother
hadn’t married a Scotsman, Stick!”</p>

<p>“What’s that got to do with—”</p>

<p>“You’ll die a poor man, Stick, just on that account,”
returned his chum gloomily. “Left to itself,
the Irish in you would risk a dollar now and
then, but that Scotch blood sets up a howl every
time.”</p>

<p>“It’s all right to take a chance,” said Stick
seriously, “but there’s no sense in being risky.
I say, with what you have, won’t a hundred and
twenty-five do?”</p>

<p>“It will have to,” answered Russell grimly, “if
that’s all you’ll come in with. I’ve gone too far
now to back down. I spent a whole day in New
York, and every one was mighty decent, and I arranged
for a whole raft of stuff to come down the
twenty-second. The Proctor-Farnham people
even offered me ninety days’ credit. You see,
their goods are new in the East, Stick, and they’re
making a big try to get them going. They make
mighty good stuff, too, and I’m pretty certain we
can sell a lot of it once we’re started. Of course
we’ll have to carry the other makes, too. Some
fellows won’t look at a thing unless they grew up
with it! Well, anyway, they were quite enthusiastic
about the scheme and would have pretty
near stocked us up for nothing if I’d agreed to
sell only their stuff. But that wouldn’t do. Not
yet, anyhow. They offered to send a man down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
to arrange a window display, but I had to decline
that, for I didn’t want them to know that we
hadn’t even found a store yet. They might have
thought I was crazy. As it was I did a good deal
of bluffing, I guess, and talked as if I had about a
million dollars. The other folks were a heap more
haughty, although they were willing enough to let
us have a fair line of samples. They don’t have
to offer inducements to sell their goods, you see.
Well, now about the money, Stick. I’ve got a
little more than two hundred. That’s three hundred
and twenty-five, about three hundred and
forty, really. I’d hoped for four hundred at least.
It means that we’ll have to be satisfied with a
more modest store, for it’s store rent that’s going
to be the principal expense for a while. I’ve been
pretty well over the town, Stick. There are two
places I’d love to have, but they’re both on West
street and the rent would be something awful.
Then there are a couple of places out on the way
to the station. They’d be cheap enough, but I
guess we might just as well throw our money away
as locate out there. Fellows never get that far
from school.”</p>

<p>“No, we’ve got to be somewhere around Bagdad,”
replied Stick. Bagdad was the Academy
name for the two blocks on West street lying nearest
to the school. Here was established a small
shopping district quite distinct from that further
in the town, one depending largely, though by no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
means wholly, on the students for trade. The
stores that lined both sides of the street were
usually small, but, in the parlance of trade, “select.”
One found neckties of a rather more
“zippy” coloring here, hats with a more rakish
air, shoes with more character, clothing that bordered
yet did not infringe on the sporty. And,
of course, the stationery store carried the sort of
books and blanks and binders and pens that Alton
Academy affected, while The Mirror specialized
in such highly colored and ultra sweet concoctions
of ice cream and syrups, fruits and nuts as are beloved
of all preparatory school youths everywhere.
Bagdad, in short, provided for so many
of the wants of Alton students that only once in
a blue moon was it necessary for them to seek
further afield.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Russell agreed, “but I don’t believe we
can find anything very close that we can afford to
take. There’s one place—”</p>

<p>He broke off to look thoughtfully across at
Stick.</p>

<p>“Well?” prompted the latter.</p>

<p>“It’s upstairs, over The Parisian Tailors, on
West street. But I don’t like the idea, Stick. You
know yourself that a chap won’t climb a flight of
stairs if he can find the same thing by walking a
block or two further. And there’s Crocker’s store
only five doors beyond. I guess that wouldn’t do.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go and have another look,” suggested<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
Stick. “There must be some place we can have.
We’ve got an hour before we need to eat, Rus.
What do you say?”</p>

<p>“All right, but there’s no use going to Bagdad.
We might try River street below West.”</p>

<p>“Huh, no fellow ever sets foot over there! I
say, I’ve got it!”</p>

<p>“Shoot, then, Stick.”</p>

<p>“We’ll hire half a store from some one who
doesn’t need it!”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, that might do,” replied Russell
slowly, “but where are we going to find it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Maybe we can’t, but it’s an
idea, isn’t it? Something to work on, eh? Let’s
go and have a look.”</p>

<p>The journey of the little red car came to an
end in three days instead of four, for Matilda developed
distressing symptoms at a place called
Bradford, got vastly worse at Mystic and broke
down utterly some two miles short of New London.
There for the present the three travelers
left her and completed the trip by rail, parting
one afternoon in the Grand Central Station with
assurances of a speedy reunion.</p>

<p>Four days later, on the twenty-second, which
was a Monday, Harley McLeod and Jimmy Austen
reached Alton shortly after two o’clock and at
half-past three were out on the football field with
some sixteen other candidates. To-morrow would
bring more, but sixteen wasn’t so bad for a first
session, and Martin Proctor, this year’s captain,
was plainly elated.</p>

<p>“Twenty-two fellows had the call,” he said to
Harley and Jimmy after they had shaken hands,
“and you fellows make sixteen who have shown
up. That’s mighty good, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“When’s Johnny coming?” asked Harley.</p>

<p>“Not until Wednesday. He telephoned this
morning. He expected to come to-day, but something’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
happened. We won’t need him, anyway.
We can’t do much more to-day and to-morrow
than get the kinks out. Oh, say, Jimmy, that reminds
me. You’ll have to put in a lot of time on
punting this fall. Keep that in mind, will you?
Practice whenever you get a chance, like a good
fellow. We’ve got to work up a kicking department
with not much to build on. And we play
Lorimer in a little over three weeks!”</p>

<p>“How does it seem to be captain, Mart?” asked
Jimmy, grinning.</p>

<p>Mart Proctor smiled back, shook his head and
then looked suddenly grave. “Well, so far,
Jimmy, being captain’s been a cinch. Spring practice
was short and easy, as you know. And during
the summer all I’ve had to do is write about a
dozen letters a week, read half a million clippings
sent by Johnny Cade—he cuts out everything he
sees that relates in the slightest way to football
and piles it all on me!—and try to look stern and
important; and you know that’s no easy job for
a merry wight like me! But since I got here yesterday
afternoon I’ve discovered that being captain
of the Alton Football Team is about the same
as being President of the U. S. of A. That guy
Johnson’s been at me every ten minutes with a
new problem, Jake’s sitting over there on the
wheelbarrow trying to think up a new worry—
Oh, gee, here comes Johnson again now!”</p>

<p>Henry Johnson, the football manager, was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
short, rotund and very earnest-seeming youth.
His forehead, above the big spectacles that
adorned his short nose, was creased into many
deep furrows as he greeted Harley and Jimmy
warmly but hurriedly and turned to Mart.</p>

<p>“Peter says he can’t get the lines marked out
to-morrow, Mart,” he announced agitatedly.
“Says he hasn’t enough lime. Says he ordered
it and it hasn’t come, and—”</p>

<p>“We can get on without lines,” replied Mart
calmly but a trifle wearily. “Can’t you find anything
better than that to bother about, Hen? You
ought to leave that small stuff to your helper.”</p>

<p>The manager’s frown relaxed slightly. “Tod
hasn’t come yet.” The furrows came back. “He
promised to get here to-day. He ought to be here,
too. Some one’s got to look after the weighing,
and I don’t see how I can do it, Mart. I’ve got
that letter to get into the five o’clock mail—”</p>

<p>“Let the weighing go until to-morrow,” said
Mart. “We’re all old stagers and don’t need
watching yet. You attend to the letter. Tod may
come on the four-twenty, for that matter. Well,
let’s go, fellows! Oh, Brand! Brand Harmon!
Take a bunch of the backs out and throw around,
will you? You’re in that, Jimmy. Mac, you’d
better come with me and we’ll try some starts.
You’ve got six or eight pounds that you don’t
need, and so have I. Throw out some balls, Jake,
will you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>Jakin, the trainer, opened the mouth of the big
canvas bag and trickled three scarred and battered
footballs across the turf. Ned Richards,
quarter-back candidate, pounced on one and
slammed it hard at Paul Nichols, last season’s
center, and Nichols caught it against his stomach,
doubled his heavy body over it and gave a high-stepping
imitation of a back getting under way.</p>

<p>“Mawson off on a one-yard dash,” he laughed.</p>

<p>“Shut up, Paul! Show respect to your betters!”
And Mawson quickly knocked the ball
from his grasp, caught it as it bounded and hurled
it smartly against the back of the center rush’s
head.</p>

<p>“You’re likely to break the ball if you do that,”
warned Ned Richards. “Hit him in the tummy
instead.”</p>

<p>There was an hour and a half of rather easy
work, which, because the September afternoon was
warm and still, reduced most of the candidates,
veterans though most of them were, to perspiring,
panting wrecks of former jauntiness. Two laps
about the track at a slow jog did nothing to restore
their freshness!</p>

<p>Harley McLeod and Jimmy Austen plodded
back to the gymnasium together, Harley wiping his
streaked face with one gray-clad arm. “I didn’t
know I was so soft,” he sighed. “Bet you I
dropped four pounds this afternoon, Jimmy.”</p>

<p>“Soft living plays the dickens with a fellow,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
granted Jimmy. “I feel like a pulp myself. I
guess if we weighed in this afternoon I’d be six
pounds over. Gee, but it’s good to be back again,
Mac. The old field felt mighty fine underfoot,
what? What’s on for a week from Saturday?
High School, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Yes. They scored on us last year, too. Remember?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Gil Tarver missed an easy tackle that
day. I didn’t get into the game. Did you?”</p>

<p>“No, Macon played right end. Banning scored
on us, too, last fall. Maybe it’s a good plan to
get a couple of kicks in the shins in the early season.
Wakes you up, maybe. Anyway, we came
back and beat Kenly to the king’s taste!”</p>

<p>“Hope we do it again, but I guess it’s her turn
this year.”</p>

<p>“That’s the wrong thought, Jimmy. Kenly
ain’t got no turn. Hold that, son. Say, maybe
that shower isn’t going to feel swell! Oh, boy!”</p>

<p>“Some fine moment, I’ll remark! By the way,
where are we eating?”</p>

<p>“Down town. Lawrence doesn’t open until
Wednesday morning. We’ll get Mart and Rowly
and some of the others and go to the Plaza. You
can get a pretty good steak there.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Jimmy as they entered the building,
“but I don’t like those unclothed tables,
Mac.”</p>

<p>“Well, you don’t have to eat ’em! Wonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
what’s at the movie theater to-night. Want to
go? My treat.”</p>

<p>“Sure! Under such unusual circumstances—”</p>

<p>But Harley had hurried away to his locker.</p>

<p>Stanley Hassell, who roomed with Jimmy in
Upton Hall, arrived early on Wednesday, registered
at the office, unpacked and bestowed his belongings
in their accustomed places to a running
fire of comment and information from Jimmy and
then accompanied the latter to the field and looked
on while the now greatly augmented company of
football candidates went through a long practice
under a hot autumn sun and the darting eyes of
Coach Cade. “Johnny,” as he was generally
called—though not to his face—was a short, compactly-built
man of some twenty-eight years with
a countenance rather too large for the rest of him
on which various small features were set; such
features as a button-like nose, two extraordinarily
sharp eyes, a somewhat large mouth and a
very square chin. Mr. Cade had rather a fierce
appearance, in spite of his lack of height, but this
was largely owing to a great deal of thick black
hair that stood up bristle-like and defeated all attempts
to make it lie down. Add to these items an
extremely mild and pleasant voice and you have
the Alton Academy football coach as he appeared
to the many new candidates that afternoon.</p>

<p>Recitations began on Thursday morning, and
the four hundred and odd youths of various ages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
from twelve to nineteen who composed this year’s
roster took up scholastic duties again. When the
nine o’clock bell pealed in Academy Hall the dormitories
began to discharge their quotas. Young
gentlemen, armed for the first fray of the term
with text-books and note-books and pencils and
pens, set their faces toward the vine-clad and venerable
Academy Hall, along the flagged walk on
which the morning sunlight, dripping through the
trees, cast golden pools amongst the cool shadows.
From Haylow, on the left of the row, from
Lykes, beside it, from Borden at the extreme right
and from Upton that was next, the youths trickled
into the two streams that flowed briskly toward
their confluence, the entrance to the big brick recitation
hall. There were all sorts and conditions
of boys in that larger stream that eddied through
the wide doorway; short boys and tall boys, stout
boys and thin boys, boys who swaggered and boys
who went with the diffidence of the stranger, boys
with sunburned faces and boys with cheeks too
pallid, boys in short trousers and boys in long
trousers, boys with straw hats, boys with soft caps
and boys with bare heads, high-spirited boys and
home-sick boys, eager boys and boys whose feet
lagged on the steps; all kinds, all descriptions of
boys; just such a medley as is always found when
the bell summons to the first recitation on a late
September morning.</p>

<p>In a month, even in so short a time as a week,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
maybe, the sorts will be fewer, the difference between
this boy and that less apparent. Already
the influences that in the end mold all toward a
certain pattern will have been felt, and Jack will
have begun to model his conduct and speech and
attire after those of Tom, who, impressed with
the stamp of one or more years at the school, already
tends toward the ultimate pattern. That
pattern varies with different schools, yet it is
much the same in essentials, and, on the whole, it
is a good pattern, being founded on a wise discipline
and builded of cleanliness of mind and
healthfulness of body, of self-respect and self-control
and, always, the love of fair-play.</p>

<p>To-day there was the genial warmth of a still
New England early autumn morning over the
scene. The elms and maples that bordered the
streets still held their verdant leaves and the grass
that grew between the graveled roads and paths
that intersected the School Green was still unchanged.
The Green extended along the west side
of Academy street for two blocks and from that
quiet thoroughfare arose at an easy grade for the
width of another block to the line of brick and
limestone buildings that spanned it. Yet, following
the center path, one passed two structures ere
the wide steps of Academy Hall were met: on the
right, near River street, Memorial Hall, containing
library and auditorium and a few class rooms,
and on the left, close to Meadow street, and partly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
hidden by trees, the modest and attractive residence
of the Principal, Doctor Maitland McPherson,
known to the School more simply, yet quite
respectfully as “Mac.” Behind the main row of
buildings stood two others, the Carey Gymnasium,
a recently built, up-to-the-minute structure, and,
to its left and directly back of Academy Hall,
Lawrence, where Alton boys flocked thrice a day
and performed certain rites at many long, white-draped
tables. Having passed Lawrence and
Carey, one passed a cluster of tennis courts and
saw, spread out before him, several acres of fine
turf whereon, close at hand, were set many steel-framed
stands between whose tiered seats appeared
the blue-gray ribbon of the running track
and the gleaming white lines of the first team gridiron.
To the left was the diamond, and ere the
further confines of the tract stayed the wandering
gaze a second baseball field and a second gridiron
met the sight. Far away was a faint glint
that told of the river, though the stream was hidden
for most of its way by trees that, beyond its
winding course, marshaled themselves into a forest
and marched westward over the low hills
toward the sunset.</p>

<p>But we have wandered far afield. Let us retrace
our steps as far as Upton and climb the first
flight of stairs. Half way along the corridor to
the right is a door numbered 27, and under the
numerals two cards are secured with thumb-tacks.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
These bear the following inscriptions, in the first
case written, in a rather round hand, with pen and
ink, in the second case imprinted by the engraver’s
art: Russell Wilcox Emerson—George Patterson.</p>

<p>Beyond the now closed door only one of the
young gentlemen named is to be found. Russell,
seated in front of the study table in the center of
the small yet pleasant room, bends over a sheet
of paper that looks very much like a bill of goods.
At the top in fat black letters appears the legend:
The Proctor-Farnham Sporting Goods Company.
Follows a Broadway, New York, address, and then
come many typewritten lines, each ending in figures
that form a column down the right-hand margin
of the sheet. With pencil in hand, Russell
reads, frowns and lightly checks the items, and
finally, having reached the bottom of the paper,
he leans back in his chair, taps the pencil against
his teeth and stares dubiously across to the open
window. During the last few days it has become
more and more apparent that the merchant who
starts in business with insufficient capital must
expect anxious moments. Removing his gaze from
the window, Russell opens the small drawer at the
right and takes out a very new bank book. Reference
to the first—and so far only—item set down
therein fails, however, to lift the frown from his
brow, and, sighing, he looks once more at the appalling
total beneath the column of figures on the
bill, shakes his head, returns the small bank book<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
to the drawer and glances at his watch. Although
the nine o’clock bell had held no summons to him,
it will be different when ten o’clock comes, and
it is already very close to that hour. So he places
the troubling bill in the drawer, drops several
other documents upon it and hides them all from
sight with a slightly vindicative <em>bang</em>. But, had
you been there to look over his shoulder, your
gaze would doubtless have fallen on the topmost
document and you would have perhaps wondered
at the presence of what was at first glance a florist’s
bill. Then, however, looking further, you
would have beheld beneath the printed inscription—“J.
Warren Pulsifer, Florist, 112 West Street”—the
scrawled legend:</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />
<small>JIMMY READS THE PAPER</small></h2>
</div>


<p><cite>The Doubleay</cite> was written and edited in the
sanctum in Academy Hall and printed in a small
job printing shop over Garfield’s grocery on State
street. As school weeklies go, <cite>The Doubleay</cite> was
a very presentable sheet. Typographical errors
were only frequent enough to encourage the reader
of a humorous turn of mind to a diligent perusal
of the four pages; the advertising matter was attractively
displayed and the editorial policy was
commendably simple, being to present the news
accurately and briefly. The paper was published
on Thursday and distributed to subscribers and
advertisers by a more or less efficient corps of six
young gentlemen, usually freshmen, who received
the munificent reward of half a cent per copy.
The first issue of the paper this fall came out on
the second Thursday of the term, and, according
to custom, contained six pages instead of the usual
four, the added matter consisting of the student
list arranged by classes and printed on two sides
of a half-sheet under the impressive legend: <cite>The
Doubleay—Supplement</cite>.</p>

<p>Now, if your transom was open when the carrier
reached your door you found the paper on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
floor when you returned to your room, or, if it happened
to flutter under a bed or into the waste-basket,
you discovered it the next day or a week
later or not at all, as the case might be. To-day,
however, Stanley Hassell pushed it aside with the
opening door when he and Jimmy returned from
the gymnasium and, picking it up, tossed it to the
table.</p>

<p>“All the news that’s fit to print,” he commented.
“The old <cite>Flubdub’s</cite> out again, Jimmy.”
Stanley intended no disrespect to the journal: he
merely used the customary name for it. Jimmy
sighed as he sank into a chair and reached for
the paper.</p>

<p>“Why, I’m glad to see its cheerful face again,”
he murmured. “And doesn’t it look familiar! I
wonder if any of the old friends of my youth are
missing.” He was silent a minute as he turned
the pages and as Stanley stretched himself on a
window-seat that was four inches too short for
him. “No,” Jimmy went on, “they’re all here:
Sampson’s Livery, Girtle, the Academy Tailor,
Go to Smith’s for Stationery, The Best Soda in
the City, College Last Shoes—all the dear, familiar
old friends of me youth, Stan. And here’s
Gookin, the Painless Dentist, still holding out a
welcoming hand, and the Broadway Theater and
the New York Haberdashery and—yes, here are
a couple of new ones! I tell you, Stan, the old
<cite>Flubdub’s</cite> a live un! ‘After the Game—Drink<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Merlin Ginger Ale.’ Now, why should I, Stan?
Seems to me it’s not enough to just tell me to
drink the stuff: they ought to give me a reason
why—hello! Well, I’ll be swiggled! Listen to
this, will you? ‘The Sign of the Football. R. W.
Emerson and G. Patterson announce the opening
of their shop at 112 West street with a full line
of Athletic and Sporting Supplies and cordially
solicit the patronage of their fellow students.
Quality goods at New York Prices. Academy Discount.
“PandF spells Best!”’”</p>

<p>“That’s the Emerson we found waiting on
table at the hotel,” exclaimed Stanley interestedly.
“At least, I suppose it is. I don’t believe
there’s another Emerson in school.”</p>

<p>“I’ll soon tell you,” said Jimmy, rescuing the
Supplement from beside his chair. “Emerson,
E., Dribble—that’s a swell cognomen, if you ask
me!—Dutton, Eager—none in the senior class.
And none in the junior—yes, there is, ‘Emerson,
Russell Wilcox, Lawrence, N. Y., U. 27.’”</p>

<p>“That’s this fellow,” said Stanley. “R. W.,
Russell Wilcox. Any others?”</p>

<p>“N-no, not in the— Hold on, though. Here’s
another in the freshman bunch: ‘Emerson, Ernest
Prentice—’”</p>

<p>“Not him. He wouldn’t be a freshie. Besides,
the initials aren’t right. But who’s G. Patterson?”</p>

<p>“Seems to me I remember a Patterson,” mused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Jimmy. “Of course! You know him; at least by
sight. Tall, thin gink; curly hair; Canadian, I
think. Rooms in Upton. Wasn’t he trying for
baseball last spring?”</p>

<p>Stanley nodded. “Yes, but didn’t make it. I
believe he’s a bit of a tennis shark. I remember.
Maybe he and Emerson room together.”</p>

<p>“Right-o!” corroborated Jimmy, referring
again to the list. “What do you know about them
opening a store? Got their courage, what? Athletic
goods, eh? Well, honest, Stan, there’s a
mighty good chance for some one to handle a decent
line of athletic goods here. Crocker never
has what you want, or, if he has, it’s so old it falls
to pieces before you can use it. Remember the
glove you bought last spring?”</p>

<p>Stanley nodded earnestly. “Fool thing went to
pieces the third time I wore it,” he grunted.
“Crocker’s higher than thunder, too. He
doesn’t know the War’s over yet! Wouldn’t
be surprised if these fellows did pretty well,
Jimmy.”</p>

<p>“Nor I; and I hope they do. This Emerson guy
seems to have a lot of grit, or—or something.
Initiative, too. Plucky chap. I liked his looks that
day at Pine Harbor.” After a moment, his eyes
returned to the advertisement, “Say, what do you
suppose this cryptic bit means? ‘PandF spells
Best.’ What’s PandF?”</p>

<p>“You may explore me,” replied Stanley, yawning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
“Maybe a misprint for P and E, Patterson
and Emerson.”</p>

<p>“But it’s ‘Emerson and Patterson.’ Besides,
the thing’s run together, like one word.”</p>

<p>“It’s probably put there to make fellows curious,
just as it’s made you, Jimmy. Sort of a—a—what
do they call ’em? Slogans, isn’t it? Like
‘It Floats,’ or—or—” But to save his life Stanley
couldn’t think of another example, and he subsided
on the pillows again with a grunt.</p>

<p>“Yes, but what’s ‘PandF’?” reiterated Jimmy,
frowningly. “Potatoes and Farina? Pork and—and—”</p>

<p>“Cabbage,” suggested Stanley. “Queer how
your thoughts always run toward food, Jimmy.
Isn’t there anything else in the paper?”</p>

<p>“I guess so. Let’s see.” Jimmy turned to the
first page. “‘Record Enrollment’; that’s about
the number of fellows; four hundred and twenty-four,
Stan: ‘estimated.’ Don’t see why they have
to estimate. Maybe they didn’t have time to count
’em, though. ‘New Courses Offered.’ Avaunt!
‘Football Situation.’ Hm, the usual twaddle.
‘Not in recent years has the Team lost so many
of its first-string players by graduation.’ Guess
that’s so, too. ‘Of those who started the Kenly
game last Fall but three remain to serve as a
nucleus about which to build this year’s Eleven;
Captain Proctor, tackle, Nichols, center, and Mawson,
half-back. The situation is not, though, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
desperate as this fact would make it appear, as
there is much excellent substitute material on
hand. Rhame and McLeod, ends, Rowlandson,
guard, Cravath, center, Richards, quarter-back,
Harmon, Austen, Longstreth and Kruger, half-backs,
and Browne and Linthicum, full-backs, have
all had experience, and from them Coach Cade will
doubtless be able to select a Team of no mean
ability. What may develop from the new candidates
is problematic, but nearly always one star
appears unheralded.’ Hurrah! There’s a lot
more of it, but as I don’t see my name again we’ll
quit. And here’s the schedule. ‘Alton High
School, Banning High School, Lorimer Academy,
Hillsport School, New Falmouth High School,
Mount Millard School—’ Say, look where Mount
Millard comes, Stan; second game from the last!”</p>

<p>“Sure! Why not?”</p>

<p>“How come?”</p>

<p>“Why, you dumb-bell, didn’t they whale us last
year, 19 to 0?”</p>

<p>“That’s so, but—”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ve put them down the list where we
can handle them. Who’s next?”</p>

<p>“Oak Grove. Then Kenly. We have three
games away from home.”</p>

<p>“All faculty will allow. Good thing, too, if you
ask me.”</p>

<p>“I hadn’t, old dear, but I will. What’s the
answer?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>“Takes too much money traveling around with
the team.”</p>

<p>“Oh! Yes, there’s something in that. Here’s
a bit about the baseball situation, but who cares
about that? Let’s see, now—”</p>

<p>“Read it,” commanded Stanley.</p>

<p>Jimmy looked across protestingly. “But it’s of
absolutely no interest to any one except a few mistaken
idiots who—”</p>

<p>“<em>Read it!</em>”</p>

<p>“Oh, well!” Jimmy sighed. “‘Fall baseball
practice, which started Monday, brought out an
unusually large field of candidates. Six of last
year’s creditable Team were on hand—’” Jimmy
paused and sniffed. “‘Creditable!’ How do they
attain that condition? ‘On hand, and practically
all of the Scrub Nine. Of new men the more
promising at present are Dixon, who hails from
Springfield High School, and Jameson, from Earl
Academy. Captain Grainger announces that daily
practice will be held as long as the weather permits,
and asks all those who expect to take part
in baseball next Spring to report at once.’ There,
there wasn’t a single mention of your name, Stan.
I knew there was no call to read the piffle.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have a corking team this year,” mused
Stanley.</p>

<p>“Huh, you said that last year, and look what
Kenly did to you!”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” replied the other warmly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
“We landed seventeen out of twenty-one games
and tied one—the best record in—”</p>

<p>“Son, you lost to Kenly, and that’s the unforgivable
sin,” interrupted Jimmy didactically.</p>

<p>“Oh, well,” grumbled Stanley.</p>

<p>“Not, of course, that baseball is a sport to be
taken seriously,” continued Jimmy lightly. “We
can lose at soccer and tennis and baseball and still
hold our heads up; which is extremely fortunate,
too. Those minor sports—” He broke off to
dodge a cushion, and then looked at his watch.
“Geewhillikins, Stan! It’s after six! Move your
lazy bones and let’s eat!”</p>

<p>Whereupon all was bustle and action in Number

<small>RUSSELL EXPLAINS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Doubtless Doctor McPherson’s copy of <cite>The
Doubleay</cite> was delivered to him absolutely on time,
but the Doctor was always a busy man, and this
was still very close to the beginning of the term,
and so it was not until he was at ease in his very
large and very old-fashioned green leather arm-chair
that evening that he found time to scan the
pages of the school weekly. This was a thing that
he invariably did with much interest, for the paper
echoed very clearly the pulse of the School. The
Board of Editors and Managers were representative
fellows and published their opinions—which
were the opinions of their schoolmates—very
frankly. In fact, as the Doctor recalled as he
turned to the first page, there had been times when
their frankness had been almost alarming; certainly
embarrassing to him and the faculty! The
Doctor was very thorough in all that he did, which
probably accounts for the fact that, having perused
and digested the news and editorial portions
of the paper, he considered the advertisements,
and with scarcely less interest. And, having
reached one of them, he read it twice, frowning a
little, and then, drawing a memorandum-pad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
toward him along the top of the big desk, he made
three funny little characters on it, which, since
the Doctor numbered a knowledge of short-hand
among his other accomplishments, meant much
more to him than it would have to you or me.</p>

<p>The direct result of those three lines and pot-hooks
was the appearance the next forenoon of
Russell Emerson in the school office and his
prompt passage to the Principal’s private sanctum
beyond. This room, which Russell had never
before entered—and had never pined to!—was a
large, high-ceilinged chamber with cream-white
walls and woodwork and three massive windows
toward the Green. It was saved from coldness
and austerity by the huge mahogany bookcase
along the farther wall, by a soft-piled green rug
occupying most of the floor space, by a big mahogany
desk in the center of the rug and by the
presence along two walls of some half-dozen armchairs
of the same warm-toned wood. Nevertheless,
the first effect of that chamber on Russell
was awesome, if not alarming. Although conscious
of no lapse from the straight and narrow
path, he nevertheless felt most uneasy as he closed
the heavy door behind him, responded to the Principal’s
smiling “Good morning, Emerson” and
seated himself in the chair that stood beside the
nearer end of the desk. Secretly curious, he sent
a hurried look along the top of the shining mahogany,
thinking that perhaps there would be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
somewhere in sight a clew to this unexpected summons.
But the desk, save for some half-dozen
books between handsome bronze book-ends in a
distant corner, a large leather-bound writing pad
under the Doctor’s elbow and a combined ink-well
and pen-tray beyond it, was absolutely empty.
Nor did the Doctor’s brown and rather sinewy
hand hold anything that appeared like incriminating
evidence. It held, in fact—I am referring
to the hand that held anything—only a sharply-pointed
yellow pencil which the Doctor, as he inquired
politely as to Russell’s health and, subsequently,
the health of Russell’s parents, slipped
slowly back and forth between his fingers, alternating
sharpened lead and rubber tip against one
gray-trousered knee. Then he laid the pencil
down on the blotting-pad, very exactly, so that it
lay absolutely parallel to the rim of the pad, and
came to the subject.</p>

<p>“I read in <cite>The Doubleay</cite>, Emerson, that you
have opened a shop in the town—in West street, I
believe—for the sale of athletic supplies.”</p>

<p>He paused, and Russell said, “Yes, sir.”</p>

<p><a href="#image02">“Rather an unusual proceeding, Emerson,”
pursued the Doctor</a>. “Unusual, that is to say, at
this school. It may have been done elsewhere.
Would you mind telling me why you have embarked
in this—ah—enterprise?”</p>

</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_47">“Rather an unusual proceeding, Emerson,” pursued the
doctor</a></div>
</div>

<p>“Why,” replied Russell a trifle blankly, “to
make money.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>“I see. But do you really need money? That
is, more money than, I presume, your parents
allow you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered the boy emphatically.
“My tuition is paid until the end of this term,
sir, but if I’m to remain here for the rest of the
year I’ll have to pony up—I mean I’ll have to
pay for it myself.” Russell paused, frowned a
little and looked speculatively at the Principal.
The latter smiled faintly and nodded.</p>

<p>“Yes, I would,” he said.</p>

<p>Russell looked a bit startled and a bit questioning.</p>

<p>“Tell me all about it,” explained the Doctor.
“You were wondering whether you should,
weren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Well, I—” Russell began apologetically.
Then he smiled and began anew. “You see, sir,
my father isn’t very well off. I guess I oughtn’t
to have come here in the first place, but I wanted
to pretty badly, and father said I might as well
have the best as any, and so I came. It went all
right the first two years, but last spring things
got sort of bad in our town. Folks got out of
work and went away, and those that stayed didn’t
have much money and didn’t spend much of what
they had. And a good many didn’t pay their
bills. So father’s business sort of ran down and
we didn’t have much money.”</p>

<p>“What is your father’s business, Emerson?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>“He keeps a store, sir, a sort of general store.
He told me away back last March that if things
didn’t pick up soon there wouldn’t be much chance
of my getting back here, and I tried to think of
some way of making money so I could come back.
I’d helped in the store a good deal and so, naturally,
I thought of selling something, and I was
pretty sure that athletic goods would go pretty
well here, because there isn’t any one in town that
makes a specialty of them, you see. Crocker, the
hardware man, carries some, but he tries to shove
off second-rate stuff at first-class prices, and the
fellows have been stung a good deal. Then there’s
another man away down town, Loring, who carries
a few things, but he’s a good distance off, and
his stuff is kind of second-rate, too. When the
football team or the baseball team or the hockey
team want supplies they send to New York for
them, and that takes time and they don’t get any
different goods than what we carry.”</p>

<p>“I see,” commented the Doctor interestedly.
“And so you and Patterson, your room-mate, decided
to start this shop. That was last spring,
you say?”</p>

<p>“We didn’t exactly decide then, sir. That is,
I decided to do it if I could, but I couldn’t get
Stick—that’s Patterson, sir: his name’s George,
but every one calls him Stick—I couldn’t get him
to promise until about the middle of the summer.
I’d have gone into it alone, only I didn’t have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
enough money, and Stick had some he’d saved
and I wanted it. You see, it takes quite a lot to
get a thing like this started, sir.”</p>

<p>The Doctor nodded gravely. “Undoubtedly,”
he agreed. “And between you, you managed to
get enough together to put it through, Emerson?”</p>

<p>Russell shook his head ruefully. “No, sir, not
enough, but—well, it has to do,” he answered a bit
defiantly. “Stick didn’t want to—I mean he
found he couldn’t put in quite as much as he
thought he could, sir, and I didn’t make quite as
much during the summer as I’d expected to, and
so it left us sort of short when the time came.”</p>

<p>“You worked during the summer, then?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I waited on table at the Pine Harbor
House. They didn’t have a very good season.
Too much rain and cold weather. A lot of the
fellows made less than I did, though, so I guess
I oughtn’t to kick,” added Russell thoughtfully.</p>

<p>There was silence for a moment, and then the
Doctor, having taken up his pencil again, said:
“I don’t want to pry into matters that don’t concern
me, Emerson, but it must have taken at least
several hundred dollars to start this shop of yours.
Now, just suppose that there isn’t the demand for
your wares that you anticipate. What then? It’s
going to whisk that money away, isn’t it? You’ve
laid out most of it, I presume, on goods, you’ve
had to sign a lease of the premises you occupy
and you’ve paid some rent already. Have you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
thought what may happen? What happens every
day in retail business?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” replied Russell. “It’s a risk, I
know, but it isn’t as big as you think, I guess.
We didn’t have much money to start on and so
we don’t stand to lose very much, even if all went,
which it can’t. We’ve taken only half a store and
we’ve leased it by the month. A florist has the
rest of it, a man named Pulsifer. You see, we
couldn’t afford to take a whole store, not where
we wanted it, and so we made an offer to this
florist fellow and he fell for it right away. He
had more space than he needed, except around
Christmas and Easter time, and he was quite keen
about renting it. Then we haven’t put in a very
big stock, sir. You see, there are so many things
that we have to handle that we just couldn’t begin
to keep them all. So we have samples of most
everything and a fair line of the fall things. If
we don’t happen to have what’s wanted to-day
we telephone to New York for it and we get it
to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“I see,” said the Doctor. “And of course you
aren’t depending solely on the Academy trade?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, we’re after the High School fellows
and the public generally. But we do expect to get
a good deal of patronage from the Academy. In
fact, sir, what I want to do ultimately is persuade
the athletic teams to trade with us instead of New
York!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, I endorse your courage, Emerson, and I
trust you won’t be disappointed. That is—”
The Doctor stopped and frowned at the pencil.
“To be frank, Emerson,” he went on, “I had
some idea of persuading you to give up this
scheme when I sent for you. I say persuading
because there is nothing in the rules of this institution
that empowers me to forbid it. The
mere fact that it has never before been done
doesn’t prohibit it; although it is probably the
reason that there is no regulation that does! I
dare say you can understand why the faculty
would view such a proceeding askance, Emerson.”</p>

<p>Russell looked frankly puzzled and finally shook
his head. “No, sir, I’m afraid I can’t,” he said.</p>

<p>The Doctor’s brows went up a trifle and he
smiled faintly. “Really? Doesn’t it occur to you
that keeping a shop might interfere somewhat with
the real purpose of your presence here?”</p>

<p>“You mean it might keep me from studying,
sir?”</p>

<p>“Exactly, from study and progress, which, after
all, Emerson, are what you are here for.”</p>

<p>“Why, but don’t you see, sir,” exclaimed Russell,
“that if I don’t run that store I can’t stay
here? Why, I—I’m doing it just because I want
to study and learn! I’m doing it so I <em>can</em>, Doctor
McPherson!”</p>

<p>The Doctor’s golden-brown eyes lighted kindly
and the creases that ran from each side of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
straight nose to the corners of his rather wide
mouth deepened under his smile. “Yes, I do see
it, my boy,” he replied heartily. “And because
I see it I’ve quite changed my course of action
since you arrived. I certainly would not like to
see your example followed by—well, by many of
your companions, Emerson. And for that reason
I trust shop-keeping won’t become the fashion
here at Alton! But in your case—well, we’ll see
how it works out. I sincerely hope that we shall
be satisfied with the results, Emerson. And I
certainly hope you will, too. In fact, I wish you
the best of luck, my boy. And, while I know very
little of merchandising, I’ll be very glad to give
you any assistance in my power. And”—whereupon
the Doctor’s eyes twinkled—“I’ll certainly
patronize ‘The Sign of the Football’ in preference
to the gentleman who keeps second-rate goods at
first-rate prices! Good morning, Emerson.”</p>

<p>“Good morning, sir,” stammered Russell.
“And—and thank you.”</p>

<p>“Not at all. And let me know how you’re getting
on sometime!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
<small>BILLY CROCKER DROPS IN</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Alton played her first game two days later,
against the local High School team. The latter
had suffered quite as much as the Academy from
graduations, and the eleven that took the field to
oppose the Gray-and-Gold knew very little football.
Alton fairly ran High School off her feet
in the first half, scoring three touchdowns and
missing two excellent opportunities to kick goals
from the field because of the Coach’s instructions
to play only a rushing game. Along in the third
period Mr. Cade began to send in substitutes, and
ere the brief contest was ended Alton had tried
out just twenty-one players. There was only one
score in the last half, the result of a blocked kick
on Alton’s thirty-two yards. High School, held
for downs, had attempted a goal, but a plunge of
eager Alton substitutes had borne down the defense
and the ball had bounded aside from some
upstretched arm to be gobbled up by Harmon and
borne fleetly down the field. There was little opposition,
for the nearest High School pursuer
reached the final white line a good two yards behind
the swift-footed left half-back. Harmon,
rather tuckered, was taken out and Mawson replaced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
him, and it was Mawson who strove to add
another point to the Academy’s total of 26. But
his attempt was weak and the ball never threatened
the cross-bar. That was in the third period.
In the fourth the playing on both sides became
amusingly ragged, and fumble followed fumble
and signals were mixed and the spectators fairly
howled with glee at times. Twice over-eagerness
was penalized under the visitor’s goal and so two
more probable touchdowns were averted. High
School showed one brief session of determined offensive
in the third quarter and, taking advantage
of Crocker’s sleepy game at right end, managed
two long runs which, together with a rather
flukey forward pass, landed the pigskin on Alton’s
twenty-two yards. There, however, the attack
petered out and, after losing seven yards in three
downs, High School faked a try-at-goal and tossed
forward over the line, where the ball landed untouched
on the turf.</p>

<p>Considered even as a first contest, the afternoon’s
performance wasn’t encouraging from an
Alton standpoint, for the line had been slow and
had played high, the backs had worked every man
for himself, with no semblance of team-play, and
even Ned Richards’ generalship had been particularly
headless. Against an equally green and
much lighter team, Alton had failed to show any
real football. However, one swallow doesn’t make
a summer, nor one game a season, and so Coach<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
Cade had little to say after the contest, and the
audience, taking itself lazily away through the
warm sunlit afternoon, chose to view the humorous
aspects of the encounter and disregard its
faults. Harley McLeod did fairly well at right
end until he gave way to Billy Crocker, and
Jimmy played at right half during a brief and
glorious third quarter and retired with a bruised
and ensanguined nose.</p>

<p>In the Coach’s room, across Academy street
from the Green, Mr. Cade and Captain Mart Proctor
conferred long that evening and in the end
reached the conclusion, among other less certain
ones, that the task of building a team this fall was
going to be a man-sized job!</p>

<p>Jimmy had determined that he would drop in
at the Sign of the Football and look the shop
over at the first opportunity. By that he meant
the first occasion when he was in want of something
that might reasonably be expected to be on
sale there. But it didn’t seem that the opportunity
would come, for, with the football management
supplying everything from head harness
to shoe-laces, there wasn’t anything he stood in
need of. Nor, between the reading of the advertisement
to Stanley that Thursday afternoon and
the hour of eleven on the following Tuesday, did
he even get as far from the Green as West street.
He had heard, though, many comments on the
Sign of the Football. Among his acquaintances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the store was treated as something of a sensation,
while Russell Emerson and his partner in the enterprise
were both scoffed at and commended.
The idea of an Alton student descending to shop-keeping
disturbed many fastidious ones, while
others thought it rather a joke—though they
couldn’t seem to put their finger on the point of
it!—and still others declared that it was a corking
good stunt and they hoped Emerson and his pal
would make it go. Jimmy lined up with the latter
when the matter was discussed in his hearing, and
so did Harley McLeod, as, for instance, on Monday
night when a half-dozen fellows were gathered
in Harley’s room in Haylow. The number included
Jimmy and Stanley, Ned Richards, Harley’s
room-mate, Billy Crocker and Cal Grainger,
the Baseball Captain. It was the latter who introduced
the subject when, apropos of something
Ned Richards had said regarding his finances, he
informed them that anything approaching financial
depression wouldn’t bother him hereafter as
he and Brand Harmon were going to open a tea
shop in the town.</p>

<p>“Keeping a shop is getting to be all the rage,”
he explained airily, “and those that get into it
early are going to reap the shekels. Brand and I
have got it all doped out. Some swell little joint
we’re going to have, too. Rose and gray is to be
the—the color motif. We’re going to have three
kinds of tea: hot, cold and Oolong; and a full line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
of sandwiches and cakes. Wait till you see us
swelling around there with the High School girls!
Fine moments, boy, believe me!”</p>

<p>“Better stock up with chewing gum,” suggested
Ned Richards. “From what I see, I guess that’s
about all those High School girls ever eat!”</p>

<p>“You’re jealous because you didn’t think of it
yourself,” retorted Cal untroubledly.</p>

<p>“Hope you get more trade than those fellows
who opened the sporting goods store are getting,”
said Billy Crocker. He was a rather large, though
not heavy, youth, with black hair and thick eyebrows
that met above his nose. The latter, being
beak-like, gave him an unattractively parrotish
look. Billy lived at home, in the town, but spent
most of his evenings at the Academy. He wasn’t
especially popular, and fellows sometimes found
themselves wondering why it was he was so frequently
in evidence at such gatherings as to-night’s.
The explanation, however, was very simple.
Billy Crocker took his welcome for granted
and didn’t wait for a formal invitation. Being a
football player, he affected the company of the
football crowd, and although many protested him
as a nuisance he was allowed to tag along. “I’ve
looked in there twenty times,” continued Billy,
not too truthfully, “and I’ve never seen any one
there yet. They’re a couple of nuts!”</p>

<p>“As a member of the Alton Academy Merchants’
Association,” began Cal protestingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>“They must have some money they don’t need,”
interrupted Ned Richards enviously. “I heard
they’d put a thousand dollars into the thing.”</p>

<p>“A thousand dollars!” scoffed Billy Crocker.
“More like a hundred! Why, those fellows
haven’t any money, Ned. They’re on their uppers.
Patterson wears clothes that were made
when Grant took Richmond!”</p>

<p>“What scandal is this?” murmured Jimmy.
“Who’s Grant?”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s what I heard,” replied Ned
coldly. “Of course, if the gentlemen are personal
friends of yours, Crocker—”</p>

<p>“They’re not, thanks,” answered Billy emphatically.
“I don’t—”</p>

<p>“They’re friends of mine, though,” cut in Harley.
“At least, Emerson is. And I wish him luck.
He’s got courage, that chap. Guess it’s so about
his being poor, though, for we came across him
two or three weeks ago waiting on table at a
hotel at Pine Harbor. He was a good waiter,
too.”</p>

<p>Jimmy rather wished that Harley hadn’t told
that, for, while he had only admiration for the
deed, he doubted that Ned and Cal and Billy
Crocker would view it in the same way. However,
no one looked other than faintly interested;
no one, that is, save Billy Crocker. Billy laughed
scornfully. “Those fellows would do anything to
get a bit of money,” he said. “It was Patterson<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
who wore Irv Ross’s suit up and down West street
a couple of years ago, with a placard on him like a
sandwich man, and all for a dollar and a half.
You fellows remember.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but it was Stacey Ross’s suit, and not
Irv’s,” said Stanley. “Girtle charged Stacey ten
or twelve dollars more than he charged another
chap for the same thing. Girtle said it was because
the other fellow paid cash and Stacey didn’t,
but Stacey was mad clean through and got Patterson
to put the suit on and walk up and down in
front of the store with a placard saying ‘Bought
at Girtle’s.’ Of course the clothes hung all over
Patterson—”</p>

<p>“That’s all ancient history, Stan,” said Harley.</p>

<p>“Well, what I was getting at is that, as I remember
it, this fellow did it for a joke and wasn’t
paid for it.”</p>

<p>“He certainly was paid,” exclaimed Billy. “I
know!”</p>

<p>“He ought to have been,” remarked Ned.
“Anyway, Stan, there’s no sense in arguing with
Crocker about what his friends do or did. He’s
in the know, aren’t you, Crocker?”</p>

<p>“I told you they aren’t my friends,” answered
Billy gruffly. “I don’t know either of them, except
by sight.”</p>

<p>“Then why,” asked Ned, yawning, “persist in
talking about ’em?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>“I only said they wouldn’t make that store
pay,” replied the other defensively. “And they
won’t.”</p>

<p>“Say, Crocker,” inquired Jimmy, “isn’t it your
father or uncle or something who runs the hardware
store?”</p>

<p>“Father,” said Billy in a tone that suggested
reticence.</p>

<p>“Thought so. Maybe you’re a bit prejudiced
then. You folks sell the same line of stuff as
Emerson and Patterson do, eh? Guess you don’t
like the idea of a rival almost next door.”</p>

<p>“All those fellows will sell won’t affect my
father any!”</p>

<p>“Say!” This explosive exclamation came from
Stanley, who suddenly sat up very straight on
Ned’s bed and fixed Billy with a baleful glare.
“Say, is that your store, Crocker?”</p>

<p>“My father’s,” answered Billy with dignity.</p>

<p>“Well, say, let me tell you something then. You
sell the punkest stuff that ever came out of the
ark! Honest, Crocker, you do! Say, if Patterson’s
clothes were made by Grant at Richmond,
or whatever it was you said, the baseball gloves
you take good money for were made by Mrs.
Cleopatra the day she got bitten by the snake!”</p>

<p>“They’re just as good as you can get anywhere,”
protested Billy indignantly. “Baseball
gloves aren’t made as well as they used to be,
since the War, and if you got a bum one you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
ought to have brought it back, Hassell, and—”</p>

<p>“There wasn’t enough of it to bring back,” said
Stanley grimly, “after the third time I put it on!
And I’m blamed if I see what the War’s got to
do with baseball gloves. The trouble with you
folks is that you got stocked up about twenty
years ago and the moths have got busy!”</p>

<p>The rest, with the notable exception of Billy
Crocker, were laughing and chuckling at Stanley’s
tirade. Billy was flushed and sulky. “We can’t
help it,” he muttered, “if the sewing on a glove
gives way sometimes. That’s the way they come
to us, and we buy the best we can find—”</p>

<p>“Listen,” said Stanley impressively. “The
sewing was the only part of that glove that held
together! It was the leather that was rotten, and
if I—”</p>

<p>“Have you still got it?” demanded Billy,
goaded to desperation. “If you have, bring it to
the store and I’ll see that you get another.”</p>

<p>“Of course I haven’t got it,” answered Stanley
disgustedly. “I bought it last spring, and the
last I saw of it, it was hanging over the wire netting
back of the home bench, where I pitched the
blamed thing!”</p>

<p>“Well, the next time, you bring it back,” said
Billy. “We don’t want any one dissatisfied.”</p>

<p>“There ain’t going to be no next time,” answered
Stanley significantly. He subsided on the
pillows again. “No hard feelings, Crocker,” he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
added apologetically, “but your store certainly
does carry a bum lot of athletic goods.”</p>

<p>There was more laughter, and Billy decided to
join in, which he did with what grace he might,
and the troublesome subject lapsed.</p>

<p>Crocker left some twenty minutes later with
Cal Grainger, although the latter showed no overmastering
desire for his company, and when the
door was closed Stanley asked: “What do you see
in that fellow, Mac?”</p>

<p>“How do you mean?” asked Harley. “He isn’t
my pal. He comes to see Ned.”</p>

<p>“What?” demanded his room-mate. “Gosh, I
never asked him here! I thought maybe you had.
I’m not keen for him, let me tell you. I’ve hardly
spoken a hundred words to him, and then only on
the field, and did you hear him calling me Ned?
Cheeky bounder! I was tickled to death when
you pitched into him about your old glove, Stan.
He was as sore as a poisoned pup!”</p>

<p>“<em>Old</em> glove!” exclaimed Stanley, in arms again.
“It was a <em>new</em> glove, gosh ding it! And I wore it
just three times and—”</p>

<p>“Oh, sweet odors of Araby!” groaned Jimmy.
“You’ve gone and got him started again! Listen,
you fellows! I have to hear the history of that
glove ten times a day, and it does seem that when
I get out in society, as ’twere, I might—might—”</p>

<p>“Glove?” broke in Harley gravely. “What
glove is that? Did you have a glove, Stan?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, dry up,” muttered Stanley. “I’m going
home. But I’ll tell you chumps one thing,” he
went on with returned animation. “Those fellows
who have the new store are going to get <em>my</em>
trade!”</p>

<p>“Ha! Their success is assured!” cried Jimmy.
“Stan buys a fielder’s glove every spring, and all
they’ve got to do is hold until maybe April or
May—”</p>

<p>“Any one been in there yet?” asked Harley.</p>

<p>No one had, it appeared. “I haven’t even seen
the place,” said Ned. “I hear they’ve got a real
jazzy sign, though; a football, you know, hanging
on a whatyoucallit.”</p>

<p>“Sounds mighty effective,” mused Jimmy.
“Just what is a whatyoucallit?”</p>

<p>“Oh, a—one of those things that stick out—”</p>

<p>“A sore thumb?”</p>

<p>“—From a wall. A crane, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“I think that’s a bird,” replied Jimmy, “but I
know what you mean. A—a sort of—of iron projection—”</p>

<p>“Brilliant conversation, I’ll say,” interrupted
Stanley. “Come on, you dumb-bell. The best
place for an intellect like yours is a pillow.” He
propelled Jimmy, still struggling for expression,
to the door. “So long, fellows! What he means
is an arm.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t!” wailed Jimmy as the door
closed. “I don’t!”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
<small>JIMMY GOES SHOPPING</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Jimmy was very conscientiously obeying Mart
Proctor’s request to practice punting. As a
senior who was not overburdening himself with
extra courses, Jimmy had several periods of leisure
between nine in the morning and three in the
afternoon, and while these periods came at different
hours on different days they never failed, and,
as it happened, Tuesdays came very close to being
full holidays for him. On those days his morning
was blissfully free from the requirements of class
attendance, and not until eleven-thirty did his
schedule mean a thing to him. Usually there was
some one on the field when Jimmy arrived who
was quite willing to chase his punts and kick
them back to him, and so he had already put in
a good many hours of work outside the regular
practice sessions. He had requisitioned a football
from Jake and kept it in his room, since more
often than not he went from dormitory to field
without stopping at the gymnasium for a change
of raiment. Casting aside his jacket, he was ready
for the task, since he always affected knickerbockers.
An old pair of football shoes, one having a
tan lacing and the other a black, which ordinarily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
kicked about under his bed collecting dust, were
donned before leaving the room. On Tuesdays,
however, Jimmy dressed for the work and engaged
the aid of some football aspirant whose
hours of leisure matched his.</p>

<p>On this particular Tuesday, the day following
the small events narrated in the preceding chapter,
Jimmy, having picked up the football from
where it had lodged under Stanley’s bed, viewed it
with disapprobation. It was a very old ball, and
a very scarred and battered one. As Jimmy mentally
phrased it, it had whiskers all over it, by
which he meant that what may be termed the epidermis
of the ball was abraded and scruffy and
adorned with little—for want of a better word—hang-nails
of leather which in Jimmy’s opinion
mitigated seriously against both distance and accuracy.
Of course he couldn’t expect a brand-new
ball, but it did seem as if Jake might have
found one less feeble and senile than this! Why,
the poor thing ought to have been retired on a
pension years ago! Jimmy viewed it dubiously
and at last distastefully, dropping it from one
hand to the other. If he had a decent ball to
work with—</p>

<p>Well, why not? If the management wouldn’t
afford him one, why not buy one of his own?
Why not indeed? Jimmy tossed the ancient pigskin
from him, unmindful of direction or ultimate
destination, pulled out the top drawer of his chiffonier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
and selected two bills from a number that
reposed in a small box there. Then he looked at
his watch. He had commandeered Neirsinger, a
quarter-back candidate, for half-past nine. It was
now twelve minutes after. In eighteen minutes
he could get to West street, purchase a new football
and—well, if not reach the field at least get
within sight of it. So, stuffing the money in a
pocket, he hurried forth and down the stairs and
across the Green by an illegal but well-defined
path that led straight to the center gate. Being
like most of us a creature of habit, Jimmy’s subconscious
mind was leading him to Crocker’s hardware
store, and to Crocker’s hardware store he
would have gone, so, doubtless, moving Stanley to
reproaches, had his eyes not caught sight of an
unaccustomed object when, having traveled the
block between the Green and West street, he
turned to his left on the latter thoroughfare.</p>

<p>The object was suspended above a doorway a
half-dozen rods from the corner, a sign about two
feet in length and somewhat less than a foot and
a half wide. It hung from a projecting wrought-iron
rod, at right angles to the building, and presented
a bravely gay broadside to the passers, for
paint and gilt were still new and fresh upon it.
There was background of dead black against which
was portrayed a golden-brown football. Above
and below the ball read the legend in plain but
quaintly old-fashioned lettering: Sign of the Football.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
The letters, like the molding that surrounded
the whole, were of gilt. In its way, that
swinging sign was quite a work of art, and Jimmy,
who had a keen appreciation of the picturesque,
paid it tribute ere, stopping stock-still two doors
away, he viewed it fixedly, frowningly for a moment.
Then:</p>

<p>“‘Inverted bracket,’” he muttered triumphantly.
“‘Inverted bracket.’ That’s it!”</p>

<p>He went on triumphantly, aware now that he had
no business to transact at Crocker’s, and wondering
that he had forgotten the new store. Under
the glittering sign he stopped and observed the
windows. In that at his left were displayed four
weary-looking geraniums, bearing a few pink
blossoms, in pots; two ornamental vases filled with
dahlias of various hues; a glass sign that leaned
against the vases and proclaimed in gold letters
against a black ground: Pulsifer the Florist—Funerals
a Specialty; and, finally, somewhat in
the background and so unobtrusively suggestive,
a wreath of artificial ivy and white roses. Jimmy
turned from this appalling display with a shudder
and moved to the window beyond.</p>

<p>This, he told himself commendingly, was better.
Against an expanse of clean white paper lay, at
either side, a pennant; at the left the gold-and-gray
of Alton, at the right the blue-and-white of
High School. Between these had been assembled
a fairly enticing array of seasonable articles: a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
football, a head harness, a nose-guard, one of the
small horns affected by umpires, a shining nickel
whistle, two pairs of shoes, two pairs of woolen
hose, a tennis racket, a box of felt-clad balls and
one or two other objects. Across the back of the
window hung a low curtain of dark blue material
and against it was a colorful poster: a brawny
youth in togs, football nestled against his ribs,
arm outstretched, face stern with ferocious determination,
spurning a vividly green sod beneath
flying feet. Below the figure was the cryptic
legend: “PandF spells Best.”</p>

<p>Jimmy entered the store. It wasn’t a very large
store, even for West street, and it was rather dark.
On the left was the establishment of J. Warren
Pulsifer: a long counter, bare save for some wrapping
paper and a box of pins, a desk surrounded
by iron grilling, a refrigerator, or what looked
like such, behind whose glass doors could be indistinctly
glimpsed a modest stock of flowers in
tall, brown papier-mâché receptacles. There were,
also, two tiers of shelves back of the counter, and
these held an array of dusty boxes. Behind the
iron grilling a tall, dejected looking man with
faded hair and mustache looked anxiously up from
his desk as Jimmy entered and then with a slump
of his narrow shoulders that was, Jimmy was certain,
accompanied by a sigh of relief, returned to
his occupation.</p>

<p>The other side of the store held a duplicate of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
the long counter, but it had been recently varnished
and so presented a different appearance.
Varnished, also, had been the shelves beyond,
while a six-foot show-case near the entrance lent
an added air of luxury. In fact, this side of the
store was, in contrast, almost startlingly gay.
Boxes of various colors thronged the shelves, pennants
hung above them, a blue-and-white sweater
lay across the counter, articles of leather and
metal gleamed from the show-case, show-cards and
posters and placards were numerous. Jimmy
thought, in fact, that there were rather too many
of these latter, even if they did lend a certain air
of business. Viewing cannily the, after all,
rather scanty furnishings and stock on hand, he
felt that there was something akin to bravado in
that display of advertising placards.</p>

<p>There was but one customer within when Jimmy
arrived, a small youth of perhaps a dozen years
who was frowning doubtfully over a helmet displayed
before him on the counter. Behind the
latter stood the senior partner of the new firm,
and at Jimmy’s appearance he looked up inquiringly.</p>

<p>“Hello,” said Jimmy, ending his leisurely inspection
of the premises. “I’d like to get a football,
please. No hurry.” He had quite forgotten
Neirsinger and the flight of time.</p>

<p>“Just a moment,” answered Russell. The boy
laid the helmet down with a sigh of rejection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>“Maybe I’ll be back,” he muttered, and turned
away from the counter with a last desirous look
at the article.</p>

<p>“All right,” replied Russell cordially. “Glad
to see you.”</p>

<p>Jimmy smiled as Russell turned to him.
“Didn’t have enough money, I guess,” he said.</p>

<p>Russell shook his head, and smiled, too. “I
showed him a cheaper one, and one that would
have fitted him, but he said he wanted to buy one
he could ‘grow into’! You wanted a football?”
He reached to a shelf behind him, drew down a
box, set it on the counter and took the lid off. The
box was empty, and he pushed it aside and reached
for another. “Silly to put the empties back on
the shelf,” he said carelessly as he opened the next
box. Jimmy’s gaze roved over the rows of boxes
and he smiled quizzically, but to himself.</p>

<p>The football looked very good to him as he
searchingly examined it, but it was different from
those he had been used to, a fact explained when
his eyes fell on a design lightly burned into the
outer leather. It was a diamond enclosing the
characters “P. &amp; F.” Curiosity clamored. “Say,
for the love of lemons, Emerson, what does ‘P. &amp;
F.’ mean?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Proctor and Farnham. They’re the makers.
Ever used any of their goods?”</p>

<p>“No, never heard of them. New folks?”</p>

<p>“New in the East. They’ve been making footballs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
and things for years and selling in the West.
They’ve just begun to go after this part of the
country and we succeeded in getting the agency
here. Very good stuff they make. Notice the way
that ball is sewed? Those seams can’t open in a
hundred years, I guess. And that leather’s the
best horsehide procurable. There’s a big difference
in leather, you know. Some balls scuff up
the first time they’re used after they’ve been once
wet.”</p>

<p>Jimmy nodded. “I know. Looks pretty good,
still I’m sort of used to the other balls, Emerson.”</p>

<p>“I can sell you your kind,” Russell returned,
“but I’d like awfully to have you try one of these.
You see, fellows are sort of shy of new things and
you’ve got to get them started. After that they
go all right. If you care to try this Proctor and
Farnham ball I’ll guarantee to give you a new
ball or your money back if you decide you don’t
like it after a fair trial.”</p>

<p>“Fair enough,” said Jimmy. “I’ll take it. By
the way, what’s the price?” His eyebrows lifted
when he heard it and he frowned a little. “What’s
the price of the others?”</p>

<p>“Just the same,” replied Russell, folding a
paper neatly about the pasteboard box.</p>

<p>“But that’s forty cents less than Crocker asks!”
protested Jimmy.</p>

<p>“Then they ask forty cents too much,” answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
the other calmly. “I think you’ll find
Crocker’s prices going down before long.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t wonder,” agreed Jimmy. He
picked up a pair of greenish-gray sport hose from
the counter. “How much are these?”</p>

<p>“Three and a half,” said Russell. “We’ve got
some good ones for less, though.”</p>

<p>“Guess I don’t need any just now, but those
are mighty good-looking. Doing any business yet,
Emerson?”</p>

<p>“Fair,” answered Russell, exchanging the bundle
for Jimmy’s money. “Of course, it takes time
to get started.”</p>

<p>“I suppose so.” With bundle in hand, Jimmy
showed little inclination to hurry away. “You
seem to have a pretty big stock here,” he went
on. “Must take some money to get a place like
this going.”</p>

<p>Russell nodded. “Quite a bit,” he agreed.
“We haven’t laid in much except fall stuff yet.
Have to go a bit slow at first.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” mused Jimmy. He was wondering if
the storekeeper recognized him. If he had he
certainly hadn’t shown it by so much as a flicker
of his eye-lids. “Say, I saw you at that hotel at
Pine Harbor, didn’t I?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, I waited on you there,” replied Russell
readily.</p>

<p>“I thought so,” murmured Jimmy. He was sitting
on the edge of the counter now, swinging his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
legs thoughtfully. “Say, Emerson, I like your
pluck,” he continued after a moment. “Working
there at the hotel, you know, and then starting
this place. Makes me feel downright lazy and no-good,
though. Hope you’ll have all kinds of success.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” said Russell, a little surprised. “I
guess I wouldn’t be doing either thing if I didn’t
have to, though, Austen; so I suppose there isn’t
much credit coming to me.”</p>

<p>“Rot!” said Jimmy. “Lots of fellows need
money and never think of getting out and hustling
for it. They just let the old man come across with
it. Don’t see why a fellow shouldn’t help his folks
put him through school and college. Wish I could
do it myself!”</p>

<p>“Can’t you?” laughed Russell.</p>

<p>Jimmy shook his head and frowned. “Wouldn’t
know what to do nor how to do it,” he answered.
“Besides, my father wouldn’t—” But he stopped
there. “How do you fix it for time?” he resumed.
“I mean, don’t recitations interfere with looking
after this place?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but we manage pretty well. You see, Patterson’s
a senior and I’m a junior, and most days
we make it go all right. If we can’t either of us
be here Mr. Pulsifer explains that we’ll be back
in an hour. I suppose we lose some customers that
way, but it can’t be helped. The store is closed
for an hour at noon, too, but lots of them do that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
in this part of town. To-day I’m here until a
couple of minutes to ten and then Stick—that’s
my partner—stays until twelve. I’m here always
in the afternoon from three-thirty to six, and
sometimes Stick comes over, too. When there’s
no one to wait on we can study pretty well here.”</p>

<p>“I thought you were playing football with the
second, though,” said Jimmy.</p>

<p>“I had to give it up,” replied Russell. “Some
one has to be here afternoons, and three mornings
a week I can’t get around at all and Stick has
to do it all.”</p>

<p>“Too bad, though,” Jimmy said. “About football,
I mean. Still, maybe they don’t need you
much. The scrubs have been pushing us around
pretty fiercely so far.” Jimmy looked at his
watch, whistled and jumped to the floor. “I must
be getting back. I’ll give this ball a try-out this
morning, Emerson, and let you know how I like
it. And I’ll see that fellows know about your
prices, too! Good luck!”</p>

<p>So Jimmy went his way briskly, a full twenty
minutes late, and Russell, folding up the stockings
that the customer had admired, smiled contentedly.
He had at last succeeded in selling a
“P. &amp; F.” football, after several attempts, and,
fortunately, to a fellow who, for some unknown
reason, was anxious to boost the store. Russell
decided to order four more balls that very day,
since, in spite of the brave array of boxes on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
shelf which looked as if they might contain footballs,
the only other ball in stock reposed in the
window!</p>

<p>When, presently, Stick Patterson arrived Russell
announced to him the sale with much satisfaction
and delegated to him the writing and mailing
of the order to New York. Stick was equally
pleased, but he voiced doubts as to the order.
“They cost a lot of money, Rus,” he said. “Better
get two instead of four, don’t you think? We
can order two more later if those sell.”</p>

<p>“All right,” Russell agreed. Sometimes Stick’s
conservatism was a trifle dampening, but he realized
that it wasn’t a bad idea to have such a
check on his enthusiasm. Without it his optimism
might some day lead him to an error of judgment.
“I’ll bet we’ll sell them, though, Stick. Austen’s
sort of a leader in his crowd, and if he likes that
ball he will say so, and from what he said I know
he wants to like it, and I’m sure he will.”</p>

<p>“I fancy the ball’s all right,” returned Stick
cautiously, “but not many fellows buy them. Did
he want tick?”</p>

<p>“No, he didn’t say anything about having it
charged. I was mighty glad, too, for I’d have
hated to have lost a customer like him.”</p>

<p>“Wish the fellows that come around when I’m
here were like that,” retorted Stick. “They always
want tick and get sore when I tell them we
don’t give credit. Any one else in, Rus?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>“Only a small kid looking at a helmet. He may
be back. I tried to sell him one of the cheap ones,
but he wouldn’t have it. Well, I’ll run along,
Stick.”</p>

<p>“All right.” Stick seated himself behind the
counter near the window, leaned his chair back
and opened his book. “Say, Rus, how much longer
do you think we can hold out if we don’t do any
more business than we’ve been doing?”</p>

<p>Russell stopped at the door and leaned across
to speak in a voice so lowered that it would not
reach the rather prominent ears of Mr. J. Warren
Pulsifer. “About three weeks, Stick,” he said
soberly. “But we’re going to begin to sell things
long before that, so don’t get the crêpe out yet.
You wait and see, Stick!”</p>

<p>“I’ll wait, all right,” grumbled Stick as the
other hurried out, “but I’m sure of one thing,
and that is I wish I’d never let him get me into
this blamed partnership!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII</a><br />
<small>THE SECOND TEAM COACH</small></h2>
</div>


<p>“Want to try a good ball, Mart?” asked Jimmy
that afternoon while the candidates were assembling
for practice.</p>

<p>Mart Proctor accepted the pigskin and looked
it over critically. “Where’d you get it, Jimmy?”
he inquired. Jimmy explained and Captain Proctor
dropped the ball to the ground, caught it on
the rise, balanced it in his right hand, tried it in
his left and then fell to a careful inspection of the
seams.</p>

<p>“Looks good,” he commented.</p>

<p>“It is good,” responded Jimmy earnestly.
“Try a kick, Mart.”</p>

<p>So Mart, nothing loth, swung a sturdy leg,
dropped the ball and watched with satisfaction its
forty-five-yard flight down the field. “Kicks
well,” he acknowledged while a willing youth
chased the pigskin and hurled it back. “Let’s see
it again, Jimmy.”</p>

<p>But while Jimmy was handling it a third person
joined them. “What make of ball is that, Cap?”
asked Mr. Cade.</p>

<p>“I don’t know. Jimmy here is booming it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
Something he got in the village at the new store
a couple of the fellows have started.”</p>

<p>“Proctor and Farnham,” commented the coach
as he read the label. “Oh, yes, I’ve heard of it.
Used out West a lot, I believe. Very sturdy looking
trick, isn’t it? Feels nice, too. A good wet
weather ball, I’d say. Grain’s very heavy, if you
notice. Gives you a good hold.”</p>

<p>“It’s the best ball I ever put a foot to,” declared
Jimmy impressively. “I can get a lot better
distance with it than I can with the ball we’re
using.”</p>

<p>The coach smiled. “They must be giving you a
commission, Austen,” he laughed. “I’m glad,
though, you like it. Only, don’t get so used to it
that you won’t be able to kick one of our sort.
How you getting on, by the way?”</p>

<p>“Oh, pretty fair,” replied Jimmy modestly. “I
guess I’m sort of getting the hang of it. Neirsinger
and I put in a couple of hours this morning.”</p>

<p>“That’s fine,” said the coach. “Well, let’s get
started, Captain Proctor.”</p>

<p>So Jimmy deposited his ball with Jake the
trainer, with instructions to guard it with his life,
and departed to the field where for the succeeding
thirty minutes he trotted about behind Appel
in signal drill. The second team proved far less
formidable that afternoon and the first walked
through its line three times for touchdowns and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
ran rings around it meanwhile. Rumor had it that
Steve Gaston, second team coach, expressed dissatisfaction
very strongly to his charges after the
day’s work was over. Certain it is that on
Wednesday there were several changes in the
scrubs’ line-up, changes which resulted in a
smaller total of points for the first team, but which
did not entirely satisfy the big coach. Gaston had
spent two seasons as a second team player, for
some not quite explicable reason never reaching
the first. Perhaps this was because he knew football
just a little better than he could play it. Last
season an injury to his leg had laid him off a few
days before the end, an injury which seemed at the
time inconsequential enough but which had afterwards
proved so serious as to bar him from football
for two years at least. Had it not been for
that injury Gaston would have been this year’s
second team captain. As it was, a wise Athletic
Committee proffered him the position of coach,
and Steve, bitterly resenting the fate which had
deprived him of the fierce joys of the game, could
have wept with delight. Of course he did nothing
of the kind. All he did do was accept with a contained
air and earnestly promise to show the committee
and the School the best scrub eleven of
recent years.</p>

<p>It is frequently easier to promise than to perform,
however, and now, in the second week of
the term, Steve Gaston was learning as much.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
He had started, a week since, with a promising
lot, many of them veterans from last year, a few
old campaigners with two years of service behind
them. He had gathered a scanty handful of likely
youngsters from last season’s freshman and dormitory
teams, youngsters, of course, who for one
reason or another were not yet varsity caliber.
Falls, an experienced guard, had been made captain,
and the second had started off with fair prospects.
The difficulty in building up a second team,
however, lies in the fact that just as sure as a
player shows anything resembling remarkable
ability a hawk-eyed first team coach snatches him
away. This is likely to happen, too, toward the
end of the season, when there is scant time left in
which to break in a substitute. But it may happen
at any period, and Steve prayed for a team that
would be composed of hard, steady workers and
that would contain not a single “phenom.”</p>

<p>The start was like most starts. The first team,
playing together better, made Steve’s aggregation
look very weak and very futile. But that was to
be expected. It took time—yes, and patience, too—to
weld seasoned, plugging veterans and inexperienced,
high-tensioned newcomers into a
smoothly-working whole. After a few days the
scrubs began to lose some of their rough edges and
Steve relaxed a bit.</p>

<p>Thursday brought new frowns of perplexity to
his rather rugged and very earnest countenance.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
The ends were not what they should be, nor did
they look to Steve like fellows who could be taught.
Then, too, on the other side of center from Captain
Falls, the guard position worried him. On Friday
he switched a full-back candidate to the guard
position and tried young Williams, who had played
quarter rather brilliantly on a dormitory eleven
last fall, at left end. But the results were not satisfactory.
The backfield man lacked the steadiness
required of a lineman, and Williams’ performance
showed Steve that he was sacrificing a good quarter-back
in the securing of a doubtful end. Steve
cudgeled his brains and, after supper that Friday
night, metaphorically seized his club and set forth
on his man-hunt. At a little after nine he arrived
at Number 27 Upton.</p>

<p>His prey, attired in a stained and faded old blue
flannel dressing gown, his stockinged but slipperless
feet supported on his bed, his chair tipped precariously
back so that the light from the green-shaded
lamp fell over his shoulder, was deep in
study. On the other side of the table Stick Patterson
sat with head in hands and nose close to
his own book. Stick was down to trousers and
shirt, for the night was warm. Visitors were infrequent
at Number 27, and so when the somewhat
imperative knock sounded both occupants looked
up startledly. It was Stick who called “Come in!”
in a decidedly ungracious tone of voice. Then
Steve Gaston entered, big and broad-shouldered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
and, somehow, momentous looking, and Russell’s
chair came down with a crash of its front legs and
his dressing-gown was ineffectually drawn together.</p>

<p>“Hello, Gaston,” said Russell, surprised.
“What—I mean— Do you know Patterson?”</p>

<p>Steve didn’t and shook hands rather perfunctorily
and took the chair that Russell yielded.
Russell perched himself on the bed and gathered
his scantily covered knees within his arms. He
thought now that he knew Gaston’s mission, for
he had suddenly recalled the forgotten fact that
Gaston had become second team coach. Steve
smiled, but it was plainly only a sop to etiquette,
or whatever law it is that decrees that a guest must
show pleasurable emotion on arrival. So, perhaps,
did the Cave Man smile ere he raised his club and
smote, subsequent to dragging off his victim. Although
Steve didn’t smite, having got that brief
smile out of his system he approached his errand
with as little delay as his distant progenitor.</p>

<p>“How does it happen you’re not with us this
fall, Emerson?” he asked severely.</p>

<p>Russell, who had determined to put on a bold
front and be as adamant to all pleas and protestations,
secretly quailed a little. There was that
about this big, serious-faced youth that made him
wish he had not been discovered in dressing-gown
and “undies”; his attire, or lack of it, put him
at a disadvantage, for it is difficult to do battle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
even moral battle, when your unclothed ankles
stare up at you from under the frayed hem of a
dressing-gown and you are distressingly aware of
a large hole in your left sock! Russell had to
blink once or twice before he answered, and blinking
took time and looked like hesitation and so
weakened his cause right at the outset.</p>

<p>“I haven’t time for football this year, Gaston,”
he answered finally. “You see, Patterson and I
have started a small store—”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know that,” interrupted Steve impatiently.
“I hope you do well, Emerson. But that
store won’t take all your time, I guess. We’re up
against it for good men this fall and I’d take it
as a real favor if you’d give us a hand, old man.”</p>

<p>That phrase “good men” didn’t unduly elate
Russell. He knew that Gaston would use it in like
circumstances to any fellow he might be after.
Still, there was a pleasant sound to it. Russell
shook his head, though, and steeled himself.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it can’t be done. I’d like to, Gaston,
but I’m in this store business to make some money,
and there’s only Patterson and me to look after it.
Patterson tends the place most of the morning,
generally, and so I have to be down there afternoons.
If it wasn’t for that—”</p>

<p>“You played end a good deal last year, didn’t
you?” Steve asked. Russell felt helplessly that
Gaston hadn’t been one bit impressed by what he
had told him. Russell nodded dolefully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>“Quite a bit,” he conceded.</p>

<p>“Thought so. We need you, Emerson. Got a
place ready and waiting for you. Fact is, I want
to make this year’s second something the School
will remember and talk about for the next ten
years. I want to turn out a rip-snorting bunch of
fellows that’ll make the first team sit up and take
notice. You’ve got to have a good scrub team if
you’re going to have a good first, Emerson. You
can’t train a first team against a lot of easy-marks
and then beat Kenly. No, sir, you’ve got to have
something hard to go up against, and the better
your second team is the better your first will be.
Well, I mean to give the school a great second,
Emerson, and that’s why I’m after you; you, and
a couple of others who have been playing possum.
I want all the good stuff I can get hold of, and,
believe me, I’m going to get it!”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course,” answered Russell uneasily,
glancing toward his room-mate for assistance.
Stick, however, was pretending to study, and Russell
saw that he must expect no help from that
quarter. He went on more firmly. “I wish I could
help you, Gaston—”</p>

<p>“Oh, not me, Emerson! Never mind about me!
It’s the School you’re going to help, you see.
Keep that thought in your mind, son. You can’t
turn down the School, can you?”</p>

<p>“Why, no, but—”</p>

<p>“When a fellow can play football, Emerson, he’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
got a duty to the School, and you don’t need to be
told that. Fellows like you don’t hesitate at a
sacrifice when the good of Alton is at stake. And
you’ve been here long enough to know that a fellow
who goes out and does his best on the second is
doing just as much for the success of the big team
as he would be doing if he played on the first instead.”
Gaston was horribly earnest, and his
brown eyes bored Russell’s implacably. Russell
stirred uncomfortably.</p>

<p>“Well, but, you see how I’m fixed, Gaston,” he
said pleadingly. “I—we’ve put quite a little
money in this thing, and we can’t afford to lose
it. Fact is, between you and me, we—the store
hasn’t got started very well yet, and it wouldn’t
do at all to get careless about it. Now, if—”</p>

<p>“No, indeed,” agreed Steve quite heartily.
“Naturally, you want to make it go. I don’t blame
you. I’d see what arrangement I could make,
Emerson.” He glanced at Stick. “I dare say
Patterson can fix it somehow to take charge in
the afternoon long enough for you to get in some
work. A couple of hours would do. Patterson
would be doing his part, too, that way. Every
fellow wants the team to win, of course, and is
willing enough to do what he can.”</p>

<p>Patterson looked over and scowled. “That’s all
right, Gaston, but I can’t tend that shop morning
and afternoon both. I’ve got recitations and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
things. Seems to me there must be plenty of
chaps for your team without Rus!”</p>

<p>“Got to have him, Patterson.” Steve arose
smiling calmly but inexorably. “You fellows fix it
up between you. You can do it better without me,
so I’ll be going along. I’m grateful to you, Emerson,
for doing what you’re going to do, even if,
as I’ve said, it isn’t as a favor to me. And the
School doesn’t miss these things either. Well, I’ll
look for you Monday, old man, and I’ll give you
a chance to be mighty useful. Good night. Good
night, Patterson.”</p>

<p>“Night,” replied Stick morosely.</p>

<p>“Good night,” said Russell. “You—you
mustn’t count on me, though, Gaston. I’ll think
it over and if there’s any possible way—”</p>

<p>“Sure! I understand. That’s the way to talk.”
Steve paused in the open door and smiled back appreciatively.
“Monday at three-thirty, then!”</p>

<p>When the door had closed Russell stared blankly
across at Stick and Stick scowled darkly back at
Russell.</p>

<p>“A nice mess you’ve made of it,” growled Stick
disgustedly.</p>

<small>AT THE “SIGN OF THE FOOTBALL”</small></h2>

<p>Alton expected a rather hard game with Banning
High School, which she had succeeded in beating
last year by the small margin of two scores
to one. Banning, however, proved scarcely more
formidable than Alton High had been, and on Saturday
afternoon the Gray-and-Gold, playing a
fairly ragged game herself, romped off with the
contest to the tune of 27 to 6. Banning’s touchdown
came to her as the result of a clever quarter-back
run from midfield to Alton’s thirty-four
yards, followed by a forward pass that again gave
her her distance and laid the pigskin on the
twenty-two. Two attempts past tackle were foiled
and Banning prepared for a try-at-goal, her left
half-back, who performed such feats for her, retiring
as far as the thirty-three yards. Alton read
in this a fear of having the kick blocked and was
unprepared for the play that followed. The Banning
half, having received the ball from center,
romped away toward the right side of the field,
drawing the adversary with him. Only Harmon,
the opposing left half, refused to be taken in, and
when, besieged by the enemy, the Banning runner
side-stepped, poised the ball and threw hard and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
far diagonally across the gridiron, over the tangled
lines of the players, it was Harmon who saw
the danger and raced to meet it. But a Banning
end, who had sneaked unobserved well toward the
left side-line, caught the hurtling ball perfectly
and, although challenged an instant later by Harmon
and plunged at by Ned Richards a few feet
from the goal line, sped over for Banning’s score.
The handful of Banning supporters cheered rapturously
and even the Alton crowd clapped their
applause for a very pretty stratagem.</p>

<p>That happened in the second quarter and practically
brought the half to its close. Banning
missed the goal and left the score 13 to 6. In the
second half Alton took revenge, adding two more
touchdowns to her portion, both in the third quarter.
Neither was spectacular, the Alton team
plunging again and again at the enemy line, satisfied
with short and certain gains. Once Moncks
was banged through from the four yards and once
Browne went over from the two. Captain Proctor
attempted three of the goals and made each. The
fourth, after Mart had given place to Butler at
left tackle, was missed by Mawson, though by a
few inches only.</p>

<p>The game showed better team-play by the Gray-and-Gold
and better generalship by Ned Richards,
but most of the faults which had been so apparent
in the earlier game were still visible. Second and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
third substitutes had their inning in the fourth
quarter and, at least, made the game more interesting
if less scientific. Jimmy Austen had two
chances to show what he could do at punting, and
whether it was because he didn’t like the ball as
well as his precious “P. &amp; F.” or whether he was
perturbed by the frantic efforts of the opponents
to get through on him, the fact remains that he
sent off two of the poorest punts seen on Alton
Field in many a day.</p>

<p>Russell wanted very much to witness that game,
but Patterson, who had been in a continual state
of disgruntlement since the evening previous,
made no offer to relieve him of duty at the store
and Russell didn’t care to make the request. So
far as business was concerned, though, he might
almost as well have gone to the field, for there
were only two customers and their combined expenditures
amounted to but three dollars and forty
cents. Russell was getting not a little alarmed
over the lack of trade. Of course, as he told himself
frequently enough, it took time to establish a
business, but now the store had been open for more
than a fortnight and the total of its sales—well,
Russell didn’t like to dwell on that! Stick was
more than alarmed. There were times when he
showed absolute panic and loudly bewailed his connection
with the enterprise. Without putting it in
so many words, he managed to convey the impression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
that he held his partner to blame for enticing
him into the enterprise, that, indeed, Russell had
somehow managed to blind his better judgment.
Stick was vastly afraid that he was going to lose
his capital, and if he could have got out without
impairment of it he would have gladly done so.
Russell frequently wished devoutly that it was in
his power to return Stick’s contribution to the
fund, but that was quite out of the question. More
than half of the capital had already disappeared.
Stock, rent, advertising, half a hundred incidental
expenses had eaten it up as a March sun consumes
a snowbank. And sometimes, looking over
the scanty stock on hand, encountering the doleful,
pessimistic countenance of Mr. J. Warren
Pulsifer, Russell thought there was just about as
much left to show! At such times he had to go
outside and look up at the gay cheerfulness of that
sign above the door. Somehow that sign always
restored his spirits.</p>

<p>This Saturday afternoon, however, as he waited
in the darkening store for the hour of six to arrive
and release him, his worries were complicated
by that overnight conversation with Steve Gaston.
Russell had a rather highly developed conscience,
and he wasn’t able to get away from the idea that
perhaps Gaston was right and that his duty to
the School ought to take precedence over everything
else. The fact that it appeared to be a physical<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
impossibility to play football on the second
team and conduct the business of the Sign of the
Football at one and the same time added to the
complications. Even if he should reach the decision
that it was his bounden duty to join the second,
how was he to do it? It would be useless to
look to Stick for assistance. Stick had already
and on four occasions assured him emphatically
that he didn’t propose to do all the work connected
with the store and that he’d be switched if he was
going to sit around down there half the morning
and all the afternoon while Russell went out and
played football. Stick wasn’t keen on football,
anyway, and he didn’t hesitate to say so. Russell
had spent a whole hour trying to work out a
schedule that would equalize their store duties and
yet give him two hours each afternoon between
three and five, and had signally failed. It couldn’t
be done. The only alternative appeared to be the
employment for a part of the day of a paid assistant,
and Stick wouldn’t consider that for a moment.
And Russell couldn’t blame him. With affairs
as they were now, paying out good money,
even a little of it, to a clerk would be rank absurdity.
In fact, Russell didn’t seriously consider
the plan himself. Faced squarely, the situation
came to just this, he ruefully concluded. Either
he must keep out of football or he must close the
store each afternoon between three and five, or
even half-past five, a period during which trade,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
should it ever discover the Sign of the Football,
might well be expected to prove heaviest. Russell
sighed and shook his head and kicked dolefully
at the counter. Kicking at the counter appeared
to bring him no relief and seemed to prove irritating
to Mr. J. Warren Pulsifer, who glanced across
reprovingly from where he was sadly making up
a funeral wreath of wilted ferns and forlorn white
carnations. Russell desisted. He wished there
was some one he might talk it over with, some one
with common-sense whose judgment he could rely
on. He had quite a number of friends and acquaintances,
had Russell, but, passing them before
his mind’s eye, he found them all wanting. Ordinarily
he could have thrashed the matter out with
Stick, but as regards the present question Stick
was badly prejudiced. And then, just as he was
giving vent to another doleful sigh, there was a
shrill and cheerful whistle at the open doorway
and Jimmy breezed in.</p>

<p>Jimmy had a badly wrapped parcel under one
arm from which protruded the label of what was,
for all the world to know, a carton of biscuits of a
popular and well advertised brand. Jimmy
whistled because he was rather in the dumps, and
it was for the same reason that, having hurried
himself into civilian clothes after the game, he had
set forth alone for Bagdad and the bazaars
thereof. It always cheered Jimmy up wonderfully
to spend money, and to-day, being in need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
of cheering after his dismal fiasco as a punter, and
having plenty of money on hand, he had fared from
store to store and bought a number of things of
which he stood in no immediate want—mostly edible!
He dumped his disintegrating parcel on the
counter and smiled brightly, gayly at Russell.</p>

<p>“Hello,” he greeted. “How’s the busy mart
of trade, Emerson?” He glanced across the store
and then swung himself to a seat on the counter.
“Guess I’ll buy me one of those things,” he went
on in a lower and confidential tone, nodding
toward the wreath. “Place it on my dead hopes,
Emerson.”</p>

<p>“Dead hopes?” repeated Russell questioningly
and smilingly.</p>

<p>“Ah,” replied Jimmy, “you weren’t at the
game, then. I see. If you had been you wouldn’t
have asked that question, Emerson. Yes, sir, my
poor dead hopes. You see, I had an idea that I
could become a punter. I toiled and moiled—
Say, what is that? Anyway, I did it, and to-day
Johnny let me in in the last quarter and I tried
twice to punt the ball and each time I—well, the
thing almost hit me on the head when it came
down!”</p>

<p>“Dropped the ball too late, probably,” offered
Russell. “I guess it takes a lot of practice, punting.
You’ll probably bring it off all right the next
time. By the way, what do you think of that ball
you bought here?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s what I dropped in about,” said Jimmy,
brightening again. “Came over for a few eats”—he
glanced unenthusiastically at the parcel—“and
thought I’d drop in and tell you about that there
ball, Emerson. It’s a corker! It’s a dream! It—it’s
all right! Say, honest, if I’d had that ball
in the game I’d have poked it fifty yards, Emerson.
Honest, I would! I like it mighty well, and
I’ve talked it up a lot. Showed it to Mart Proctor
the other day; and Johnny Cade, too. I wouldn’t
be surprised if you sold quite a few of them this
fall. Well, how are things going with you? Been
busy to-day?”</p>

<p>“Fairly,” answered Russell. Then, encountering
Jimmy’s straight and level gaze, he shrugged.
“I guess there’s no use lying, Austen,” he corrected.
“Business has been rotten this afternoon,
and every other afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Thought so,” said Jimmy. His eyes roamed
over the poorly lighted store and came back to
Russell. “I guessed the other day that a lot of
this was just bluff.” He nodded backward at the
shelves. Russell flushed slightly. “Not that it
isn’t all right,” added Jimmy quickly. “Bluff’s
a part of every game nowadays, I guess. And I
like your nerve. So business isn’t rushing, eh?”</p>

<p>“It isn’t even crawling,” responded Russell
wryly. “At least, it isn’t crawling this way.”</p>

<p>“I wonder,” mused Jimmy, “if you didn’t make
a mistake in locating over this way instead of further<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
down town. You’d ought to get the trade
from the town folks, Emerson; high school and
grammar school fellows, you know, and that crowd.
I’m afraid there isn’t enough business among the
Academy fellows to make it go. What do you
think?”</p>

<p>“Well, I wanted the Academy trade first,” said
Russell. “I can get the other trade, I believe, if
I can wait long enough. But the question is, can
I wait? I—we’ve advertised in the High School
paper, and we’re running a small ad. in the town
paper three times a week. They gave us a pretty
good reading notice last Saturday. Something
ought to come of those ads.”</p>

<p>“Sure to,” agreed Jimmy comfortingly.
“Later on, now, when fellows start baseball, you’d
ought to do better, too. Fellows buy baseball
stuff more than they do football. Take the dormitory
teams, for instance. They’ll be starting
up this week, I guess. Well, most every fellow
will have a shirt and a sweater and a pair of
breeches, and that’s about all they’ll need. Maybe
they’ll be along to buy a nose-guard or a pair of
stockings, and that’s their limit. They get an old
football from the first team, one that’s been
through ten wars, and that fixes them. Baseball,
though, is different. Every chap wants to own a
ball and a bat and, maybe, a glove—”</p>

<p>“It’s a long time till spring,” interrupted Russell.
“Look here, Austen, do you know any good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
reason why the football management shouldn’t
buy their stuff here instead of sending to New
York for it?”</p>

<p>Jimmy looked startled for a moment. Then:
“Why, n-no, I can’t say I do, Emerson. Of
course, they always have bought their truck in
New York, but—” Jimmy stopped and viewed
the other with dawning suspicion. “Say, is that
what you’re after?” he asked incredulously.</p>

<p>Russell hesitated, looked away and finally
nodded. “Yes,” he said, “it is. I haven’t told
any one else, Austen, but that’s what I had in
mind. If we can get the job of supplying the
school teams we’re fixed. We can do it, too, just
as well and just as reasonably as any place in
New York. That’s what I’m working for. It will
take time, though, and meanwhile we’ve got to
keep going. And that’s going to be the tough part.
It’s harder than I thought it would be.”</p>

<p>Jimmy was staring reflectively at the floor. At
last: “Do you know Sid Greenwood?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No. He’s basket ball captain, isn’t he?”</p>

<p>“Yes. You’d better meet him. Coolidge, too.
Bob’s hockey captain. And—yes, by jove, Stan
ought to be able to help you. You know my chum,
Stan Hassell, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Just to speak to,” replied Russell, doubtfully.
“I don’t think he knows me, though.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he does. We were speaking of you just
the other day. Now I tell you what you do, Emerson.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
You drop in at our room some night;
say to-morrow; to-morrow’s Sunday, isn’t it?
Thought so. Yes, you come around and we’ll
talk this over. I don’t see why Stan shouldn’t
have something to say about where baseball stuff
is bought. He’s captain. And I’ll try to get either
Bob Coolidge or Greenwood there; maybe both. If
you could get the job to supply the basket ball team
and the hockey team it would be a help, eh? And
then, maybe, we can wangle the baseball situation,
too, later. Gordon, the manager, is sort of a pill,
but Stan can put something over on him, I guess.”</p>

<p>Jimmy was quite radiant, and his infectious
grin met a ready response from Russell. “That’s
mighty fine of you,” stammered the latter. “It
would be a dandy start just to get one of the
teams, Austen. Don’t know why you should take
all that trouble, though. But I’m—”</p>

<p>Russell’s further and somewhat incoherent remarks
were interrupted by Mr. J. Warren Pulsifer,
who, having deposited the funeral wreath
in the refrigerator at the back of the store, now
paused nearby. “I’ll be going along, Mr. Emerson,”
he announced sadly. “Please be sure that
the door is locked when you leave. Good night.”</p>

<p>“Good night,” answered Russell. “I’ll look
after everything, sir. By jove, it’s six o’clock!”</p>

<p>“Right-o! I must toddle. You coming over?”</p>

<p>A few minutes later, having put out the lights
and securely locked the door, Russell fell in beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
Jimmy and the two went briskly off toward the
Green. Jimmy was whistling again, but now he
had quite forgotten his great sorrow and the
sounds he made no longer disguised a crushed
spirit and a broken heart. At the corner of State
street Russell broke in on the melody.</p>

<p>“Austen, I wish you’d do something for me,”
he said.</p>

<p>“Name it,” answered Jimmy promptly. “Hang
you, keep still!”</p>

<p>The latter part of the remark was addressed to
the parcel he carried, which was earnestly striving
to distribute its contents along the way.</p>

<p>“I want to—I want some advice,” continued
Russell.</p>

<p>“In that case you’ve come to the right person,
Emerson. I’m famous for my advice. What’s
the problem?”</p>

<p>Thereupon Russell told about Steve Gaston’s
visit and the resulting complications. “Now,”
ended Russell, “do you think I ought to go back
to the team, Austen?”</p>

<p>“Hm,” said Jimmy. “Well, I don’t just see
how you can, you know!”</p>

<p>“But that isn’t it. <em>Ought</em> I to? Is it my duty
to—to the School?”</p>

<p>Jimmy was silent for nearly half the block.
Then: “Well, if you want my perfectly honest
opinion, Emerson,” he said, “I think it’s every
fellow’s duty to do what he can for the old A. A.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
If you can play a fair line of football and Steve
needs you—” He stopped. “Still, there’s this
store. I don’t believe any fellow could find fault
with you if—well, if you didn’t play, Emerson.
At least—” Then his voice dwindled again.</p>

<p>“Just the same,” persisted Russell, “you <em>do</em>
think it’s my duty to, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Except for the store—”</p>

<p>“Leave the store out of it, please, Austen.”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, in that case,” said Jimmy relievedly,
“absolutely yes. Maybe I’m a little nutty on the
subject, Emerson, but I never could stand fellows
who weren’t willing to pitch in and do their
blamedest for their school or their college or—or
their country. Maybe I’m sort of sentimental, but
that’s the way I feel. I hate a quitter. Not that
you’d be that, of course, under the circumstances—”</p>

<p>“I guess, though, I would be,” said Russell
thoughtfully. “Well, that’s settled then.”</p>

<p>“Meaning you’ll go back on the second? What
about the store, though. Hang it, Emerson, you’d
better not take my say-so. Leave it to some one
else. Put it up to—to—I tell you! Have a talk
with Mr. Kincaid. He’s a good old scout and has
a fine bean on him!”</p>

<p>But Russell shook his head. “I’d rather have
your idea than any of the faculty’s, Austen. I
mean, it’s the way the fellows look at it that
interests me. You’re right, and Gaston was right,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
and I’m sure of it.” Then he smiled ruefully in
the twilight. “I wish, though,” he added, “I
didn’t have to convince Stick!”</p>

<p>“Stick? Oh, Patterson: yes, I see. He won’t
like it, eh? Look here, Emerson, why shouldn’t he
take over the store afternoons? He’s got his
money in it, the silly ass. Doesn’t want to lose
it, does he? Well, it seems to me it would be just
common horse sense for him to—to leap into the
breeches—I should say breach, eh?”</p>

<p>“He won’t though. He’s—well, he’s pretty
fairly obstinate. He doesn’t want to lose his
money, no, but he says he won’t keep store afternoons
and I know him well enough by this time
to be mighty certain that he won’t!”</p>

<p>“Silly ass!” commented Jimmy as they reached
the front of Academy Hall and the parting of their
ways.</p>

<p>“I’m awfully much obliged to you,” said Russell.
“You’ve been mighty friendly, Austen. I’ll
be around to-morrow night if you’re quite certain
you want to go to all that—”</p>

<p>“Wait a second!” interrupted the other, hunching
the dilapidated parcel further under his arm
with a thoughtful frown. “Look here, old son,
I’ve got an idea. At least, I think I have. I’ve
got something, anyhow. Would this Stick fellow
be willing to stay in the store afternoons if he
didn’t have to go there at all in the mornings?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, I think he would. I’m sure he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
would. But, you see, the trouble is that he has to
be there mornings, too. I have recitations—”</p>

<p>“<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">A bas les</i> recitations!” exclaimed Jimmy.
“Listen! Suppose you could get some one to stick
around the shop in the morning when you couldn’t.
Wouldn’t old Stick be willing to put in the afternoon
there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but we’d have to pay some one, and—just
now—”</p>

<p>“Not necessarily. At least, not much. Say—say
twenty-five cents a week. Would twenty-five
cents a week seem unreasonable? Then let us say
fifteen—ten—five!”</p>

<p>“We might pay that much,” laughed Russell
mirthlessly, “but just where could we find any
one who’d come for that?”</p>

<p>“Where?” Jimmy struck an attitude intended
to be heroic but which was somewhat marred by
the sudden collapse of the parcel under one arm.
A carton of crackers, a box of caramels, six
oranges and two unidentified articles descended to
the flagging. When the oranges had been chased
down and recovered and the wreckage stowed into
various of Jimmy’s pockets the latter took up the
conversation where it had been so rudely interrupted.</p>

<p>“You asked where you were to find this—this
paragon of industry, Emerson. In response I say
to you: Look! Behold! He is before you!”</p>

<p>“Eh?” faltered Russell. “You? You mean—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who else? Here am I with most of my mornings
wasted. Of course, I kick the jovial football
into the empyrean, but there are other times for
that. Besides, I am convinced that I shall never
cause Charley Brickley to faint with envy! When
Mart picked me to become a punter he picked a
most acidulous lime! But that aside and, as it
were, apart, Emerson. I have always had a sneaking
desire to sell things over a counter, and here’s
my opportunity. You wouldn’t want me to do it
for nothing. Your pride would rebel. So I insist
on a salary, a salary of, shall we say, ten cents a
week.”</p>

<p>“You’re—you’re fooling,” said Russell dubiously.</p>

<p>“Nary a fool! Come on, do I get the job? Let
me remind you, Emerson, that time is fleeting and
my inner man cries for sustenance. Also, doubtless,
Stan is pacing the room like a caged lion. If
the salary asked is too steep, why, I’ll compromise.
We’ll say five cents; but I won’t come down
another nickel!”</p>

<p>“Why—why—” stammered Russell.</p>

<p>“Agreed then! I’m a wage-earner at last! I’ll
drop around later and we’ll sign the contract. So
long!”</p>

<p>And Jimmy waved gayly and sprinted for
Lykes.</p>

<small>JIMMY CONSPIRES</small></h2>
</div>


<p>True to his word, Jimmy arrived at Number 27
Upton shortly after supper. Stick, to whom Russell
had imparted the proposed solution of the
problem, was not present. Stick had succinctly
declared that Russell was crazy and that he refused
to listen to any more of his ravings. He
had not, however, refused to keep store in the afternoon
in return for having his mornings free, and
that was the principal thing.</p>

<p>Jimmy declared that he had feared Russell
might change his mind about employing him and
so leave him jobless in the face of a long and cruel
winter, and consequently he had hurried right up
so soon as he had satisfied the inner man. He
had brought his schedule and when Russell had
produced his they leaned over the two cards and,
as Jimmy phrased it, doped out a course of action.
On the whole, Russell’s hours and Jimmy’s seldom
interfered, and there were but two mornings when
for more than sixty minutes the store would have
to be left to Mr. J. Warren Pulsifer’s care.</p>

<p>“Corking!” declared Jimmy. “I’ll go down
Monday morning with you and you can show me
where things are and all that. Something tells me,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Emerson, that I was born to be a merchant, and
Heaven help any poor guy that steps his foot inside
that store while I’m there. He will either
have to buy something or fight me!”</p>

<p>“Better try peaceful means first,” suggested
Russell, smiling.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I shan’t insist on trouble. By the
way, are there any punching-bags in stock? It
might be well for me to keep in trim. Let’s see,
how do you do it?” Jimmy rubbed his hands and
bowed to Russell. “Good morning, sir. Nice
weather we’re having, are they not? Tennis
balls? Certainly. Right this way, please, to the
tennis department. Here you are, sir, the finest
ball on the market. Used exclusively by the
Prince of Wales, Lloyd George and all the best
players. Covered with the most expensive Peruvian
broadcloth. Every ball filled with two thousand
atmospheres of balloon gas, making it the
lightest and liveliest ball on the market. As I
might say, sir, it’s bound to bound. We are making
a special price on them this year, eighty cents
apiece or five dollars a half-dozen. If you take
six dozen we include a high-grade racket. With a
gross we give you, absolutely without charge, a
receipt for making indelible ink. Half a dozen?
Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. Shall I wrap them up
or will you take them with you?”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you mixed on your prices a little?”
laughed Russell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>“Possibly.” Jimmy waved carelessly. “I
never was good at arithmetic. By the way, you
haven’t a cash register, have you? No? That’s
good. I’d never be a success as a salesman where
there was one of those things to keep tabs on me!”</p>

<p>“Austen,” asked Russell, sobering, “what are
you doing this for?”</p>

<p>“This? Oh, you mean <em>this</em>. We-ell—” Jimmy
blinked. “I don’t know, Russell. I thought it was
because I liked your—your pep and wanted to help
you out. But I’m not sure that it isn’t really because
I want a lark!”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s mighty decent of you, anyway,” replied
Russell. “It gets me out of a hole. You
see, I like football, Austen, even if I’m not very
much good at it, and it was sort of hard not to
play this fall. Still, I wouldn’t have thought of doing
it if Gaston hadn’t got after me. Now I’m
wondering whether I’m going to play because I
think it’s my duty to or just because I really want
to!”</p>

<p>“Jove,” said Jimmy, “you’ve got a regular
Puritan conscience, Emerson! What’s it matter?
The main thing is that you’re going to. Now sit
down and tell me about things at the store. You
give a discount to our chaps, don’t you? Well,
how about high school students?”</p>

<p>“Just the same,” said Russell. “I thought
we’d better. They might get sore if we didn’t.”</p>

<p>“I see. Still, I don’t believe Crocker does.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>“All the more reason why we should, then,
Austen.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but— Say, cut out that ‘Austen’ stuff,
won’t you? My name’s Jimmy.”</p>

<p>“And mine’s Russell,” replied the other, smiling.
“More often just Rus.”</p>

<p>“I get you! Though, of course,” Jimmy added,
“when I am on duty I shall call you Mr. Emerson!”</p>

<p>Half an hour later Jimmy paused at the door to
say: “Oh, by the way, about to-morrow night.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” replied Russell quickly.
“It doesn’t matter.”</p>

<p>“Eh? What doesn’t matter?” asked Jimmy,
puzzled.</p>

<p>“Why, I mean,” floundered Russell, “if it isn’t
convenient—”</p>

<p>“Rot! What I was about to say was that I
think it’ll be best not to be too raw, if you see
what I mean. We’ll use tact and diplomacy, old
son. You just happen in and we’ll have a social
little talk, the lot of us, and after awhile I’ll
accidentally bring up the subject of the store.
You leave it to me. Better not let those guys
suspect that we’re putting up a game on ’em,
eh? Well, so long, Rus. Drop in about seven-thirty
or a quarter to eight.”</p>

<p>Stick, when he returned to the room later, was
in a much better humor than when he had left.
He had, it developed, won two straight games<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
of billiards from another chap over in Haylow.
Russell listened with flattering attention to Stick’s
dramatic narrative of the contests, thereby increasing
the latter’s content. At last, Stick tore
himself from the engrossing subject, frowned
slightly and asked: “Well, did you and Austen
fix it up?”</p>

<p>Russell explained the arrangements. “That’ll
give you every morning free except Saturday,
Stick. Saturday Austen won’t be able to be there,
and I have a nine o’clock and an eleven. In the
afternoons, except Tuesdays— Here, this is the
schedule. I tend store every afternoon except
Tuesday from one to three. You come on at three
and stay until six. Or, five-thirty, if you like. I’ll
be down every day right after practice and I ought
to get there by half-past. How is that?”</p>

<p>“All right, I guess,” replied Stick slowly, looking
over the schedule rather as though he suspected
that something was being put over on him.
“Of course, afternoon’s likely to be the busy part
of the day, if things ever get busy, that is!”</p>

<p>“I know, but you won’t have so much to do that
it’ll wear you out,” answered Russell.</p>

<p>“It doesn’t look like it,” agreed Stick plaintively.
“Say, we’re going to lose our money as
sure as shooting, Rus!”</p>

<p>“I don’t think so,” answered the other with
more confidence than he felt. “We can’t lose it
all, anyhow, Stick. We haven’t signed any lease<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
and we can give up the place at a month’s notice.
We can return most of our stock, too.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but we’ll be out two months’ rent at the
very least, and we’ve sunk about a hundred in
rent and advertising and dolling the place up.
Pulsifer won’t allow us anything for the paint and
varnish and work we put in there, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“No, we’re bound to lose something, of course,
if we have to quit,” acknowledged Russell. “But
I don’t believe we’ll have to, Stick. Something
tells me that things are going to pick up pretty
soon.”</p>

<p>“I wish something would tell me so,” said Stick
mournfully. “I don’t mind saying, Rus, that I’m
plaguey sorry I went into it!”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t let’s give up the ship yet,” replied
the other patiently. “Toss me that Latin book
over here, will you?”</p>

<p>“What I don’t see,” went on Stick, complying,
“is what this fellow Austen gets out of it. I suppose
he’s—well, square, eh?”</p>

<p>“Of course he is,” answered Russell indignantly.</p>

<p>“Well, don’t get waxy. How do I know?
What’s he going to tend the store for without pay,
then?”</p>

<p>“He’s not. He’s on salary.”</p>

<p>“<em>What?</em>” almost shrieked Stick. “You mean
we’re going to pay him money?”</p>

<p>Russell nodded, enjoying Stick’s consternation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>“I won’t do it!” cried the other. “No, sir!
Why, hang it, Rus, we can’t afford it!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, we can,” answered Russell soothingly.
“It’s only ten cents a week!”</p>

<p>“Ten cents! Ten cents a—” Stick stared
blankly. “Is he crazy? What’s he want ten cents
for? Why doesn’t he do it for nothing?”</p>

<p>“Well, he told me that he wanted to be a wage-earner,”
explained Russell gravely.</p>

<p>Stick viewed him suspiciously. “It’s mighty
funny,” he grunted. “The whole business is
mighty funny. You and Austen are up to something,
I’ll bet. All right, but just let me tell you
that I’m not paying out my money to him!”</p>

<p>“You don’t mind five cents a week, do you?”
asked Russell, grinning.</p>

<p>“No, I’ll pay five cents, all right, but I won’t
pay a penny more. I’ve lost enough already in
the fool business!” And Stick pulled a book to
him savagely and intimated that he was through
with the subject.</p>

<p>Russell found not only the hockey and basket
ball captains in Number 4 Lykes Hall the next
evening, but Cal Grainger. These, with Stanley,
Jimmy and Russell, quite filled the room. Afterwards,
Russell learned from Jimmy that Cal’s appearance
was unsolicited and unexpected. Jimmy
managed to convey the impression that Russell
was a frequent caller, and was aided in the mild
deception by Stanley, who had been admitted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
the conspiracy. Russell was aware of the slightly
puzzled inspections of the others, but appeared
not to be. Bob Coolidge, the hockey team captain,
was a tall, slim-bodied senior with a nice smile
and a queer way of stuttering when he got the
least bit excited. Sid Greenwood was small in
comparison, with sharp black eyes, rebellious dark
hair and a quick manner of speech and movement.
Russell knew them both by sight, just as he knew
Cal Grainger, but had never been introduced to
them before to-night. He found a seat on a corner
of Stanley’s bed after the introductions had been
performed and helped himself to the caramels that
Stanley passed. The talk was concerned with
the criminality of the Athletic Committee, and
Coolidge stuttered amusingly as he thumped the
edge of the window-seat.</p>

<p>“A l-lot of Miss N-N-Nancies,” he declared
earnestly. “You’d think we were j-just kids, the
way they c-c-coddle us! Gosh! Why, look at
Kenly! They g-g-got a twelve-game sc-sc-sc-sc—”</p>

<p>“Schedule,” prompted Cal kindly.</p>

<p>“—Hedule,” went on Coolidge, batting his eyes
wildly. “And all we c-c-can get is s-seven games,
with a p-p-possibility of eight if we c-c-can p-p-persuade
Oak Grove to play here! What kind of
a sc-sc—”</p>

<p>“You can’t say it, Bob,” interposed Greenwood.
“Don’t try. We know what you mean.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
Also, son, we agree with you that the committee
is a bunch of old women and that Peghorn is the
worst of the lot. I hope he gets his bonnet-strings
all knotted up! You can’t—”</p>

<p>“Oh, Peg isn’t to blame,” said Jimmy. “He’s
no worse than the rest. What we need here is a
student council or something to talk turkey to
those antediluvian birds. How many games do
you fellows get away, Sid?”</p>

<p>“Four,” replied the basket ball leader scornfully.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s one more than we get,” said
Jimmy.</p>

<p>“Sure, but it’s different—”</p>

<p>“Taking a football team around’s not at all the
same,” broke in Cal. “You have to have thirty
or more fellows and half a dozen coaches and trainers
and nurses—”</p>

<p>“Quite different,” agreed Coolidge, eagerly.
“We take ten or eleven f-f-fellows, and it d-d-doesn’t
c-cost us anything to speak of, and we get
home early—”</p>

<p>“Having lost the game,” interpolated Cal, unkindly.</p>

<p>“Sh-sh-shut up! S-s-same with the b-b-basket
ball outfit, too. S-s-seven or eight men and n-no
expense—”</p>

<p>Russell lost the rest, for just there, under cover
of the conversation, Stanley addressed him. “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
hear you’re on the second football team, Emerson,”
he said.</p>

<p>“I’m going out to-morrow,” answered Russell.</p>

<p>“Yes, Jimmy was telling me. I guess Steve
Gaston’s going to work up a rip-snorting outfit,
if what I hear is right. Great fellow, Steve. Hard
luck, his not being able to play this year. What’s
your position?”</p>

<p>“I played end last year. Gaston wants me to
try for it again.”</p>

<p>“How’s the store getting along? Doing pretty
well?”</p>

<small>FAIR PROMISES</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Russell was spared an answer, for just then
Jimmy appealed to him. “That’s right, isn’t it,
Rus? If it wasn’t for football these fellows would
be prying up asphalt or laying sewer pipes,
wouldn’t they? We have to earn money to keep
their old hockey teams and basket ball teams going.
Yes, and pay for the crew and the baseball
nine, too!”</p>

<p>“Not by a long shot,” exclaimed Cal. “Leave
the Nine out of it, Jimmy. We’ve paid our own
way for many a season, old scout!”</p>

<p>“Pooh! Made expenses, maybe, but you
generally have to come a-borrowing from the old
sock every spring.”</p>

<p>“Well, we pay it back, son.”</p>

<p>“You fellows have to have too many bats and
gloves and fancy fixings,” continued Jimmy.
“And you wear too good clothes, too. I’ll bet it
costs you a fortune to outfit every spring, and—”</p>

<p>“Listen to him!” exploded Cal. “Great Guns,
what does it cost to run a football team?”</p>

<p>“That’s different,” laughed Jimmy. “A football
team’s worth while, Cal. Besides, when it
comes to that, those uniforms you fellows wear
cost more than a football suit, I’ll bet.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>“Rot!”</p>

<p>“Well, what do they cost? Come on, now.
Let’s hear.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, you idiot. We get ’em by the
bunch. Maybe eight dollars, maybe nine.”</p>

<p>“Can you beat that?” Jimmy appealed to the
company. “Captain of the Nine and doesn’t know
what his uniforms cost him!”</p>

<p>“That’s not my business, you chump. That’s
up to the managers. I’ve got enough to look
after—”</p>

<p>“Well, here’s a fellow can tell us.” Jimmy
turned to Russell. “What do those uniforms
cost, Rus, per uniform? You ought to know.”</p>

<p>Russell smiled and shook his head. “I’m
afraid I don’t. You can pay almost any price for
a three-piece uniform, from six dollars up to
twelve. It depends on how many you buy, of
course, and on quality, too.”</p>

<p>“Are you an authority on the subject, Emerson?”
asked Greenwood.</p>

<p>Russell shook his head. “No, not at all,” he
answered.</p>

<p>“You’re an awful bluffer, Jimmy,” laughed Cal.</p>

<p>“Not a bit,” denied Jimmy stoutly. “Rus sells
uniforms and he ought to know the prices of ’em
better than we do. It’s his busi—”</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Cal. “You’re the Emerson
who has the store on West street! Of course! I
missed that. Yes, you must know something about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
baseball togs. Football togs, too, eh? Well, tell
us, then, which outfit costs the most, Emerson.”</p>

<p>“Football,” answered Russell, smiling.
“There’s more wool. Football togs have to be
better because they get harder use.”</p>

<p>“There you are!” exclaimed Cal, in triumph.
Russell noted that Coolidge and Greenwood were
observing him with new interest.</p>

<p>“I still maintain,” said Jimmy, with great
dignity, “that one of the suits you fellows wear
costs more than my football outfit. I got my jersey
for nothing, from a chap who was leaving
school—”</p>

<p>“It looks it,” breathed Coolidge.</p>

<p>“That’s not the point,” said Cal. “Every one
knows you’re such a miser you wouldn’t <em>buy</em> anything.
We were discussing new uniforms, and
Emerson says himself—”</p>

<p>“Say, Emerson, what’s a hockey shirt w-w-worth?”
asked Bob Coolidge.</p>

<p>“I can’t say. We haven’t stocked any yet. I’ll
find out for you, though, if you want me to.”</p>

<p>Coolidge shook his head. “Thanks, no, it
doesn’t matter. I just wondered.”</p>

<p>“Bet you Rus can sell you shirts and whole
outfits, too, for that matter, less than you paid
for them last year,” announced Jimmy. “You
fellows always get stuck when you send to New
York.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>“It’s not my funeral,” said Greenwood, with a
shrug. “Let the manager worry.”</p>

<p>Coolidge, however, seemed impressed. “I don’t
know about that, B-B-Bob,” he said earnestly.
“We’d ought to get th-th-things as cheap as p-p-p-possible.”</p>

<p>“You ought, but you don’t,” jeered Jimmy.
“You pay any price you’re asked, and then go
broke before the end of the season and have to dig
into the old Ath. Com. stocking. Say, why don’t
you give Emerson a chance this year? Let him bid
on the stuff. Might as well hand the profit to one
of our own crowd as send it on to some guy you
don’t know in New York. That applies to you,
too, Cal.”</p>

<p>Cal pursed his lips. “Why, we usually buy a
goodish lot, Jimmy; new uniforms all through,
bats, balls, a raft of stuff; I’m afraid Emerson
couldn’t handle our business.”</p>

<p>“Why couldn’t he?” demanded Jimmy. “Of
course he could, you chump! Besides, the uniforms
would fit a blamed sight better than they
did last year if he took the fellows’ measurements.
This thing of sending the size of your waist and
the number collar you wear and expecting to get
a decently fitting suit gets my goat! And as for
your bats and all the other lumber you have to
have to play your absurd game, why, Emerson
could sell you those better and cheaper than the
New York folks, I’ll bet. Besides, you could see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
what you were getting, which is something you
don’t do now.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not throwing off on Emerson,”
replied Cal, throwing a kindly glance toward that
youth, “but, unless I’m mistaken, Jimmy, they
tried getting their outfits here in town several
years ago and it didn’t work. If I were—”</p>

<p>“Course it didn’t work,” interrupted Jimmy
scornfully. “They went to Crocker’s. Every
fellow knows that Crocker’s stuff is punk. I mean
his sporting goods. Maybe he keeps good nails
and—”</p>

<p>“I bought a fielder’s glove there last spring,”
began Stanley eagerly. But Cal groaned and
Jimmy threatened his roommate with the empty
candy box.</p>

<p>“I oughtn’t to have introduced the subject,”
continued Jimmy sadly. “I might have known
Stan would try to tell about his old glove—”</p>

<p>“‘Old’ is right,” muttered Stanley gloomily.</p>

<p>“I th-th-think Jimmy’s right,” declared Coolidge.
“No reason why we sh-sh-shouldn’t pat-pat-pat—”</p>

<p>“Stop talking Irish, Bob,” said Greenwood.
“Are you going to have basket ball stuff, Emerson?”</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ll have a pretty complete line by the
first of December, or a little before. I’d like to
have you come in and let me show you, Greenwood.
We’re agent here for the Proctor and Farnham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
Company, and their basket balls are certainly
corkers.”</p>

<p>“Never heard of them,” said Sid Greenwood
unenthusiastically. “We’ve always used—”</p>

<p>“He’s got the other makes, too,” assured
Jimmy. “But if those P. and F. folks make as
good a basket ball as they do a football, I advise
you to tie to them. I’ll bet even you could shoot
a basket with one of those balls, Sid!”</p>

<p>Greenwood grinned. “I’d surely like to see one
of them,” he said. “I’ll drop around some time,
Emerson, and have a talk. Of course, it’s the
manager’s place to do the buying, but I dare say
I could get him to consider your stuff. There’s
no special reason, so far as I can see, for sending
to New York for things if we can get them just
as good in town.”</p>

<p>“Say,” said Stanley, after a long silence, “why
not start a Home Consumption League, if that’s
what they’re called? We fellows represent four
of the school sports, and here’s Emerson and his
pal trying to make a little coin out of a store in
the village that sells just the stuff we buy. Let’s
see if we can’t—can’t head some trade his way.
What do you say? It took pluck to start that
store, I guess, and we all like pluck. Seems to
me he deserves to win out. And he can’t fail to
if he gets the school trade. Of course, there
wouldn’t be any favoritism about it. He’d have
to make as good prices as New York, and sell as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
good stuff, but I dare say he could do it, eh, Emerson?”</p>

<p>Thus appealed to, Russell nodded, smiling
rather seriously. “I’m quite sure we can supply
just as good stuff, including uniforms, as can be
bought in New York, and I think we can sell a little
cheaper. How much cheaper I don’t know now,
but enough to be worth considering, I’d say. Besides
that, there’d be no express to pay, for I’d
deliver the goods right to you.”</p>

<p>“S-s-sounds reasonable,” declared Coolidge.</p>

<p>“And,” continued Russell, “I don’t need to tell
you fellows that if we had the job of outfitting
some of the teams we’d be certain of making a go
of that business. We don’t ask any favors, or expect
any, but I guess we can prove that we can
sell just as high quality goods and just as cheaply
as any New York house can. We’d be mighty
glad of a chance, anyway.”</p>

<p>“F-f-fair enough,” exclaimed Coolidge. “Far
as I’m c-c-concerned—”</p>

<p>“Look here, Jimmy,” said Cal, prodding that
youth to attention with his shoe, “did you get us
here to—to work this scheme for Emerson?”</p>

<p>“Get you here!” replied Jimmy indignantly.
“Why, you poor fish, who asked you around, anyway?”</p>

<p>“Well, Bob and Sid, then. I know you didn’t
say anything to me about it. But I suspect—”</p>

<p>“Go on and suspect,” said Jimmy, virtuously.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
“I had no idea that you were coming here this
evening. If you don’t believe that—”</p>

<p>“You asked me, though,” said Greenwood,
grinning.</p>

<p>“M-m-me, too,” said Coolidge. “Not that I
m-m-mind, because—”</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I don’t mind fessing up,” Jimmy
broke in, “now that you fellows have taken the
bait. I did ask Sid and Bob—Rus, too, of course
with the notion of getting something started.
Your arrival, Cal, was as unforeseen as—er—pleasing.
There’s nothing to apologize for. Rus
is a good sort and needs to make a success of that
store over there. We can help him. So let’s do
it. Any objections?”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” said Cal, laughing. “I’ll do
what I can to steer some business to him. I don’t
make any promises, for our management have
been buying in New York for some time and aren’t
likely to make a change. Still, I’ll do my best.”</p>

<p>“We don’t buy much new stuff,” said Sid
Greenwood, “but I guess I can promise Emerson
that he shall have what trade there is.”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” murmured Russell. He was finding
the situation just a bit embarrassing in spite of
the evident good-will of the fellows.</p>

<p>“And that g-g-goes for me, too,” announced
Coolidge earnestly. “I’ll see Nagle to-morrow and
b-b-bully him into g-g-giving you a ch-ch-ch—”</p>

<p>“Spoken like a man, Bob!” said Jimmy warmly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
“Your speech is halting, but the spirit that
prompts your words—”</p>

<p>“Go to th-th-thunder!” grunted Coolidge.</p>

<p>“The Home Market Club is organized,”
announced Stanley, yawning.</p>

<p>“It was a Home Consumption League awhile
back,” objected Greenwood. “But never mind.
The motto is: Patronize Home Industries! Emerson,
I hope your place will do well and make you
a rich man; as rich as Jimmy!”</p>

<p>“And m-m-more generous,” supplemented
Coolidge. “A f-f-fellow who offers one box of c-c-caramels
to a mob like this is a p-p-p—”</p>

<p>“Introducing Mr. Robert Coolidge, gentlemen,
with his famous imitation of a flivver working on
one cylinder. Gentlemen, Mr. Coolidge!” And
Jimmy clapped loudly.</p>

<p>“—p-p-p-piker!” ended Coolidge triumphantly.</p>

<p>Whereupon the assemblage broke up, greatly
aided by a tussle between Jimmy and the hockey
captain. Russell left with the others, parting with
Cal at the stairs and with the others outside, since
both Greenwood and Coolidge lived in Haylow.
“Glad to have met you, Emerson,” said the basket
ball leader affably. “I’m coming into your place
some day soon and see what you’ve got there.
Good night.”</p>

<p>A somewhat unintelligible utterance from Coolidge
followed and Russell went his way. Of
course, reason told him, nothing might come of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
those fair promises, but he couldn’t help feeling
elated and encouraged, and even when, reaching
Number 27 Upton, he unfolded the tale of the
astounding success of the evening to Stick and was
met with gloomy pessimism his elation was not
much subdued. Stick was like that, he reflected,
and climbed into bed to lie awake a long while in
the darkness and vision rosy dreams. His last conscious
reflection ere he finally fell asleep was that
Jimmy Austen was certainly a corking chap!</p>

</div>


<p>Jimmy was at the store in the morning and Russell
went over the stock with him, explaining cost
marks and various other matters that should form
part of a clerk’s knowledge. Jimmy was, for once,
not in the least flippant, and Stick, when he finally
appeared to release Russell for a recitation,
appeared to view the new employee more leniently
than Russell had dared hope he might. Jimmy’s
duties were not to begin until the morrow, and
presently he and Russell hurried back to the
Academy together.</p>

<p>“Your friend Stick seems rather a Gloomy
Gus,” observed Jimmy on the way, “but perhaps
by kindness and forbearance we may cheer him
up. Is he taking the afternoon watch to-day,
Rus?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m going back after this class, and he’s
going to stay from three to five-thirty. Stick’s
not a bad sort, but he doesn’t put his best foot forward
very often.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t think to notice his feet,” replied
Jimmy thoughtfully. “Well, here’s where we
part. Oh, by the way, what about my attire? Do
you think I ought to—well, dress for the part to-morrow?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
Something, say, a trifle modish, eh?
Gray trousers and frock-coat, maybe, with a lavender
tie and a single black pearl in it. Or do you
think the usual more negligent dress would
answer?”</p>

<p>“I’d go in for simplicity,” answered Russell,
grinning. “What you have on looks all right.
Besides, customers might think you bought those
knickers in the store, and that would be quite an
advertisement, eh?”</p>

<p>“Right-o! Well, see you this afternoon, doubtless.
So long, Mister Employer!”</p>

<p>There was nothing very dramatic about Russell’s
return to the football fold. A hurried and
curt-spoken Gaston welcomed him with a sudden
smile and a brief congratulatory nod. “Fine,
Emerson!” he called as he passed. “B Squad for
you.”</p>

<p>Followed half an hour’s work that proved to
Russell very conclusively that he was in no good
shape for the task ahead of him. He had lost a
fortnight’s training and the fact was evident.
Long before signal drill was done he was aching
in most of his muscles and puffing like a grampus.
He was glad indeed of a short respite on the bench
before the squad walked across to the first team
gridiron, where, although the time for scrimmage
had arrived, a squad under leadership of Ned
Richards was still hustling down the field, Ned’s
voice, sharply imperative, rising above the tones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
of Coach Cade and Captain Proctor, trailing behind
and rapping out criticism. That bunch, reflected
Russell as he paused with his companions
to form a sweatered and blanketed group along
the edge of the field, was the first team’s A Squad,
although there were two players on it whose
presence surprised him. These were Crocker, at
left end in place of Lake, and Greenwood, at full-back.
Joe Greenwood was Sid’s brother, a heavy,
dark-complexioned youth who had played with
Russell on last year’s second. Russell hadn’t
thought him varsity material, but he was displacing
the veteran Browne. Possibly, though,
Browne was on the hospital list or in trouble at
the Office: Russell hadn’t been following football
very closely.</p>

<p>The rest of the squad were first-string men:
Butler, playing at left tackle for Captain Mart
Proctor, Rowlandson, Nichols, Stimson, Putney,
McLeod, Richards, Harmon, Moncks. Across the
sunlit field, the substitutes’ bench showed far
fewer huddled forms than had sat there last
week, indicating that the first cut had taken
effect. In the stands a score or so of onlookers
were scattered, their hands more often than not
thrust deeply in their pockets, for the afternoon
was chill in spite of the flood of late sunlight.
Captain Proctor detached himself from the followers
behind the squad as it trotted past down
the center of the gridiron and cupped his hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ready for you in five minutes, Gaston!” he
called. “Help yourself to the field, will you?”</p>

<p>Steve Gaston nodded and tossed a ball to the
turf. “Pass it around,” he ordered crisply,
“and keep moving.”</p>

<p>So the second team players strung out along
the edge of the gridiron in two roughly formed
ranks and, walking briskly, shot the ball from
one to another, frequently tripping over a trailing
blanket when the pigskin eluded them and
bobbed across the turf. Finally there was the
hoarse squawking of a horn and Manager Johnson
was signaling them. Two sweatered substitutes
were unsnarling the chain. From the
stand came a rat-a-tat of chilling feet against the
boards.</p>

<p>“Second team’s ball,” announced Coach Cade
through his small megaphone. “We’ll take this
goal!”</p>

<p>“Yah,” derided the scrub’s captain sotto-voce
as he pranced about, limbering his legs, “why
don’t you let us toss for it, Tightwad?” Russell
grinned as his glance met Falls’. “They haven’t
kicked off to us for a week,” the captain added
ruefully, yet smiling. “Come on, fellows! Let’s
take it away from them!”</p>

<p>“You take right end, Emerson,” ordered Coach
Gaston. “Look out for Harmon on forward
passes, boy. All right, Second! Go to it! You
fellows who aren’t playing, keep your blankets on.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
You’ll be wanted before this ruckus is through.”</p>

<p>The second lined up across the field for the kick-off,
a whistle shrilled and big Jim Newton, center,
lifted the ball well toward the first team’s goal.
Russell, following down under the kick, scanning
warily the hastily forming enemy interference,
told himself that it was good to feel the sod underfoot
again, to hear the soft rasp of canvas and
creak of leather. Then he was swinging on a heel
to dash across the field toward where Moncks, the
pigskin clutched tightly, was coming along behind
his interference. It was not Russell who stopped
Moncks, but Captain Falls. The best Russell
could do was topple Richards, in doing which he
got a fine rap on the side of his head that, partly
broken by the edge of his helmet, was yet hard
enough to make his senses swim for a moment.
When he got unsteadily to his feet again the teams
were lining up near the thirty-five-yard line. Behind
each team was its coach, and their voices
were already to be heard. Russell, skirting the
first team line to his position, saw that Captain
Proctor was at his place again. Then Ned
Richards yelped the signal, the lines swayed, met,
there were gasps and grunts, an angry, stifled exclamation
from Wells, the scrub’s right tackle, a
hoarse bellow from Falls, and Harmon was crashing
out of the welter of brown canvas bodies.
Russell, playing out and back, sprang in, eluded
the savage spring of an interferer and got his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
man, aided by Reilly, a half. But Harmon was
hard to stop, and both tacklers gave ground for
another yard ere the runner was down. Russell,
blocking with one knee Harmon’s attempt to
thrust the ball forward, muttered: “No, you
don’t!” Then the whistle piped just as reënforcements
plunged down on the group. Harmon had
made four yards outside Wells, and Wells was
mad. He muttered aloud as he crouched with
swaying arms at the end of the line, and Russell
caught his threatening, taunting words.</p>

<p>“Come on! Try that again, you big stiff! I’ll
put that long nose of yours on the blink for
keeps! Send it this way, Ned! Come on, you
Sore-Heads! Oh, you would, eh?”</p>

<p>This latter remark was to Mart Proctor, who
had feinted inside Wells as the ball was snapped.
There was an ecstatic moment for Wells, and then
Mart deposited him neatly against his guard and
tore outside him. Russell, already crossing behind
the backs, left the invader to Reilly and met
the play which was coming through left tackle.
It was Greenwood this time, and the full-back
added another three yards to the total. On the
next attempt there was a fumble by Moncks, recovered
by Richards for a yard loss. Then first
team punted, Richards dropping the ball in Goodwin’s
arms on the scrub’s twenty-yard line and
the left half reeling off seven strides before he
was downed by Crocker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>Carpenter, the scrub quarter, made two on a
wide run and then Reilly, red-headed and hard-fighting,
squirmed through Rowlandson for three
more. But that ended the advance and Kendall
punted well into enemy territory. First gained
three on a criss-cross, Harmon carrying, and then
Richards passed diagonally across the line to McLeod,
and the latter, catching the heave unchallenged,
went half-way to second’s goal before
Carpenter stopped him. Play was held up while
first team and second team coaches criticized and
instructed, and while Russell, his last breath about
gone, sat on the ground and longed for the horn
to sound the end of the period. Then he was up
again, almost on his fifteen-yard line, set for a
forward pass that didn’t materialize. Harmon
carried past Wells once more and fought and
squirmed to the scrub’s twenty-one. Falls went
down the crouching line and slapped perspiring
backs and implored his men to hold, and Gaston,
deep-voiced, shouted to Goodwin to close in and
watch that guard! Then came the play again,
and, over the heads of his plunging team-mates,
Russell saw Richards, ball in hand, trotting back
and back, saw Harmon sneaking fast across the
turf to the left, saw Squibbs dash headlong at
Richards, saw the latter side-step, calmly, smilingly,
and saw the right arm go back for the long
throw. All about him were warning voices as he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
forced his tired legs and tuckered lungs to new
exertion.</p>

<p>“<em>Pass! Watch that man! Stop that throw!</em>”</p>

<p>Russell, running, glanced back. Overhead was
the ball, a dozen yards ahead was Harmon, walking
sidewise, hands ready. Behind Russell
streamed the field, coming fast but too late to get
into the play. Carpenter was closing up the gap
between his position and the side line. Russell
called on his flagging strength for one last
supreme effort. Harmon had stopped, was facing
the descending ball, had raised his arms. Russell
was still a good six yards distant and he knew that
Harmon would be off before he could reach him.
There was but one chance and he took it. Throwing
his arms high, he leaped into the air, hoping
against hope. But fortune was with him. The
flying pigskin grazed his left hand. The touch
of it was so light that Russell scarcely felt it,
but it served to deflect the ball. Harmon swayed
to the right, the ball spurned his eager grasp and
went trickling, bouncing across the turf toward
the side line. Russell paid no further attention
to it. He eased himself gently to the ground and
turned onto his back. A minute later Lawrence
pulled him to his feet and put a strong arm under
his shoulders.</p>

<p>“Good work, Emerson,” he panted. “Better
step out. Gaston’s looking. All right now?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>

<p><a href="#image03">“Yes,” said Russell faintly. “I’m—fearfully—soft!”</a></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 409px;">
<a id="image03">
  <img src="images/image03.jpg" width="409" height="600" alt="" title="" />
</a><br />
<div class="caption"><a href="#Page_132">“Yes,” said Russell faintly. “I’m—fearfully—soft!”</a></div>
</div>

<p>They made their way back to the forming line-up,
but Coach Gaston intervened. “That’ll do,
Emerson,” he called. Then, turning to the far
side of the field, “Tierney!” he bawled.
“Tierney! Hurry up!”</p>

<p>Russell yielded his helmet and went off with
drooping head. He was heartily ashamed of himself.
He had lasted some eight minutes only! Of
course the reason wasn’t far to seek: a fellow
can’t play football if he isn’t conditioned; and
Russell realized that he was very far from
conditioned. A summer spent largely indoors
hadn’t, he thought ruefully, prepared him very
well for what was before him. He sank down in
the line of waiting substitutes and wondered if he
would ever get his breath fully back again!</p>

<p>Of course first team went over. Having reached
the twenty yard line, it wasn’t to be held by anything
the second had to offer in the way of argument.
Moncks got a good gain through center and
Harmon made it first down on the scrub’s sixteen.
From there, using concealed plays, the first wore
down the defense until, on fourth down, with the
ball on the five yards, Richards faked a forward
and passed to Moncks and the latter raced around
the second’s left for a touchdown. The period
ended soon after and the second team players
joined the substitutes and huddled into blankets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
and listened to a grave discourse on their shortcomings
and failures from the coach.</p>

<p>When the second period started Steve Gaston
put on almost a new eleven. Russell didn’t go in
again, but sat on the turf, wrapped in a faded
gray blanket, and saw Tierney play right end.
And Tierney did very well, Russell thought, even
if he did let Harmon get safely off with another
forward pass that paved the way for the first
team’s second score. For that matter, Russell
had almost done the same thing himself. He was
still wondering why he had been caught flat-footed
on that play!</p>

<p>Coach Cade likewise called on his second-string
players for the last period, and on his third-string
as well. Russell saw with satisfaction that when
Jimmy Austen supplanted Mawson at left half—Harmon
had not started the last period—his punting,
if not in the least phenomenal, was very good.
Russell got a case of mild heart-failure every
time the ball went to Jimmy for travel by the
aerial route, for Jimmy was deliberate to a fault.
It looked as though he simply hated to part from
that ball until at least two of the enemy were almost
upon him. But he had Fortune with him to-day,
and of his four punts not one was blocked
and each went its way as he fore-ordained it to;
forty yards, forty-five and, once, a magnificent
fifty-odd. At carrying the ball, though, Jimmy
met with less success, and after each of his several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
attempts Russell heard the incisive voice of the
coach dealing out rebuke.</p>

<p>Second didn’t score that afternoon, didn’t
approach to scoring, indeed, and, afterwards,
Steve Gaston’s quiet thoughtfulness indicated
that he wasn’t any too well pleased. Steve had
yanked Squibbs and Emerson back to the fold and
added two other unknown quantities in the persons
of a brace of sophomores who had messed
about with last year’s freshman team. So far,
so good, but the second team was still far from
the hard-fighting, bull-dog aggregation that he
was working for. He told himself that the weight
was there, and the aggressiveness, and the knowledge
sufficient for his ends, but that for some
reason the fellows weren’t using them. He wondered
if there was some way in which to make
the team forget that they were doing battle with
their fellows and really fight! Of the crowd, Wells
was the only one who exhibited the proper spirit.
When Wells went into action friendship ceased.
Put Wells in football togs and he would have
fought to a finish with his grandmother! Sometimes
Steve had to call the tackle down for “slanging”
too much, but he always hated to do it. If
he could only get the rest of the team into the
same frame of mind he would, he felt, have a real
eleven, an eleven that would make history.</p>

<p>On the way out of the gymnasium he caught
sight of Russell and hailed him. “I used you a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
bit hard this afternoon, Emerson,” he said, “but
I wanted to see how you showed up, and there
isn’t much time for coddling.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid I showed up pretty poorly,” said
Russell. “I had no idea a fellow could go stale
so soon, Gaston.”</p>

<p>“I know.” Gaston nodded. “You were all
right, though. Get some one to work out the kinks
in your muscles to-night. A good hot bath will
help, if you get right into bed afterwards. I’ll let
you off easy to-morrow. How did the team strike
you?”</p>

<p>Russell hesitated, for it hadn’t occurred to him
before to consider that subject. “Pretty fair,”
he said at last. “It’s early yet.”</p>

<p>“It’s never early when it comes to getting a
team in shape,” responded the coach. “I’ve got
the stuff there, Emerson, but I don’t get it out.
I will, though, by ginger! I’m going to make that
bunch deliver the goods. Well, good night. Take
care of yourself.”</p>

<p>“If I only had a tin dinner-pail!” reflected
Jimmy regretfully as he turned into West street
the next morning and caught sight of the gay sign
above the doorway of Number 112. His enthusiasm
had brought him there at a minute after half-past
eight and to his surprise the store was still
locked. But Russell had provided him with a
key and Jimmy thrust it into the lock with an important
air and swung open the creaking door.
The place exhaled a stale odor of withered flowers,
and Jimmy traversed the long aisle and threw
open the rear door as well. From the unwillingness
displayed by the bolts he judged that that
portal was seldom disturbed. He looked out.
There was a diminutive yard there surrounded by
a sagging board fence and littered with boxes and
rubbish. A gate gave onto a narrow alley beyond
which was another fence above whose rim could
be seen the trees and white gables and red chimney-tops
of the residences on State street. Jimmy
went back into the store and looked about him.
Through the front door came the morning sunlight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
displaying to his disapproving gaze a very
dirty floor.</p>

<p>“Might as well do the thing right,” said Jimmy
to himself. In a dark corner stood a dilapidated
broom. In the back yard he had noted a box half-full
of sawdust. Jimmy removed his coat, folded
it, placed it beneath the counter alongside the
cigar box that did duty as a money drawer for the
Sign of the Football, and went to work. A small
sink at the back of the store provided water, and
Jimmy moistened the sawdust thoroughly and
then, starting at the front of the place, sprinkled
it lavishly. After that, whistling blithely, he went
to work. Now and then he paused to observe a
passer or to watch hopefully some one who had
paused outside the window. But no one infringed
on his solitude; no one, that is, until Jimmy had
the sawdust swept nearly to the back door. Then
it was Mr. J. Warren Pulsifer who appeared.</p>

<p>He showed no surprise at Jimmy’s presence.
Perhaps he had overheard the arrangements being
made yesterday. But he did show a concern that
almost amounted to disapproval. “H’m,” he said
sadly, viewing the thick windrow of dirty sawdust
in front of the boy’s broom. “H’m.”</p>

<p>“Good morning,” responded Jimmy brightly.
“Cleaning up a bit, you see, sir.”</p>

<p>“Yes. H’m. Well, there’s a man comes in to
do that the first of the month. Washes the windows,
too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>“Whether it’s needed or not,” said Jimmy
innocently.</p>

<p>“Sweeping makes a good deal of dust,” continued
the other severely.</p>

<p>“Collects a good deal, too,” answered Jimmy,
continuing toward the door.</p>

<p>Mr. Pulsifer pretended to be affected by the
dust and coughed delicately. “It’s bad for the
flowers,” he said querulously. “I’d rather you
didn’t do it, my boy.”</p>

<p>He coughed again and went back to his wire
enclosure. Being called “my boy” grated on
Jimmy and he leaned on the handle of his broom
and favored Mr. J. Warren Pulsifer with a
malignant stare. Then he finished his job, placed
the now almost useless broom back in the dim
corner, washed his hands, dried them on his
breeches for want of other means and started
after his coat.</p>

<p>“Please close the back door if you’re
through,” said Mr. Pulsifer drearily. “There’s
a draft.”</p>

<p>Jimmy obeyed. When he had his coat on again
he stationed himself behind the small show-case
and looked into the street. After a while that occupation
palled and he pulled a box down from
a shelf and removed the lid. It was empty. So
was the next one. So were all boxes in that tier.
Jimmy grinned and tried the next pile. He was
more fortunate. Three gray sweaters rewarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
him. He took one out, examined it, held it before
him and shook his head.</p>

<p>“Too small,” he muttered. The others were
too small also. He put the garments back and
returned the box to its place. Then he surveyed
the goods in the window. Raising his eyes, he saw
two boys doing the same thing from beyond the
glass. They weren’t Academy fellows, nor, since
the hour was now nine o’clock, could they be high
school fellows. Yet they were well dressed and
appeared to have plenty of time on their hands.
In age they were evidently about sixteen years.
Their gazes were set on the tennis racket and they
were discussing it seriously. Jimmy could see
their lips moving, but could hear no sounds. After
a moment he withdrew from sight and went
swiftly to the doorway. There he stepped just
outside and leaned a shoulder negligently against
the frame. The two boys were still admiring and
discussing. Jimmy started to whistle, his gaze
set across the street on Whitson’s Blue Front
Pharmacy. The sound drew the boys’ attention
and at the same instant Jimmy turned his eyes
their way. Jimmy had a winning smile, and now
he used it. The nearer of the two boys smiled
back. The other drew away as though to continue
his journey along the street.</p>

<p>“Come on in, fellows, and let me show you some
things,” invited Jimmy. “I’m looking for something
to do.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>“We were just—looking,” murmured the nearer
youth.</p>

<p>“Sure!” responded Jimmy heartily. “Come
on inside and look. You don’t need to buy anything.
Let me show you a tennis racket, maybe,
or a sweater.” He drew back invitingly. There
was low-voiced colloquy and the two followed
hesitantly inside. Jimmy reached the back of the
counter by the simple expedient of placing one
hand thereon and vaulting it. That seemed to put
the visitors more at their ease, and one of them
laughed and said:</p>

<p>“Say, how much is that tennis racket in the
window?”</p>

<p>“That one?” Jimmy reached over the curtain
and brought the racket into view, as he did so
reading the tag attached to the handle. “Have
a slant at it,” he invited, handing it to the
questioner. “That’s a nice racket. One of Proctor
and Farnham’s. You won’t find another one
of those in this town.” He might have added “or
in this store,” but he refrained.</p>

<p>“Never heard of that make,” said the more
reticent boy.</p>

<p>“What?” Jimmy was surprised, but politely
so. “One of the best, if not <em>the</em> best. Ever
see Williams play?”</p>

<p>“I have,” assented the first speaker, “but I
didn’t notice what sort of a racket he used.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>“You have a look the next time,” advised
Jimmy, wondering just what racket Williams did
wield. “How do you like the feel of that? Corking
balance, eh? That handle gives a nice firm
grip, too. I’d like to own that myself.” This was
no more than the truth, although the desire of
possession was but a minute old.</p>

<p>“What did you say the price was?”</p>

<p>“Price? Oh, six-twenty-five. That’s a special
price, too. You see, we have the agency for the
P. and F. goods here and we’re selling very low to
introduce them. That racket would sell for seven
dollars in New York, I suppose.”</p>

<p>The boy nodded agreement. “Yes, I dare say
it would.” He turned to his companion. “I like
it better than Carty’s,” he said, “don’t you?”</p>

<p>The second youth took the implement and subjected
it to a minute and sustained inspection.
Finally he balanced it across a finger. Then he
stepped back and swung it mightily through the
air, smashing an imaginary ball through the doorway.
Then he handed it back, and Jimmy heard
plainly the sigh that accompanied the action. The
boy nodded soberly but convincingly. “It’s a
corker,” he declared.</p>

<p>The intending purchaser of a racket glowed.
It is always satisfying to have one’s judgment
upheld. He swung the racket himself slowly and
looked admiringly at it. At last he laid it on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
counter, and Jimmy’s heart fell. “I like it all
right,” said the youth, “but that’s more than I
want—more than I meant to pay for one.”</p>

<p>“That so? Well, you can’t get much of a racket
these days for less than six dollars,” replied
Jimmy. “You fellows know what the fancy ones
fetch; eight, nine—more if you want to pay it.”
Jimmy fondled the tightly-stretched strings admiringly.
“That racket would last three hard
seasons, I’ll bet, without restringing. You don’t
see finer gut than that very often. I like the way
it’s reënforced there, too, don’t you? That small
gut strengthens the racket without making it
dead.”</p>

<p>The two boys nodded in unison and in silence.
Two pairs of eyes were following Jimmy’s pointing
finger absorbedly. At last: “I can lend you
a dollar,” said the reticent youth in low tones.
The other turned eagerly, then shook his head.</p>

<p>“I oughtn’t to pay more than five,” he said
virtuously but sadly. Jimmy drew a breath of
relief. He was, he knew, about to make a sale,
his first sale! He drew a caressing hand along
the handle, from the black-and-gold diamond
trade-mark and the word “Runner-Up” to the
soft brown leather band at the end. The tempted
one followed the gesture, thrilling to it. Jimmy
looked up and spoke at the psychological moment.</p>

<p>“Are you high school fellows?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“Because, if you were, I could give you the regular
high school discount of five per cent. That
would make it cost you—let me see—yes, five-ninety-four.”</p>

<p>“We’re Mount Millard fellows,” said one of
the boys.</p>

<p>Jimmy pricked up his ears at that. “Mount
Millard! Is that so? What sort of a football
team have you got over there this year?”</p>

<p>“Pretty good, I guess. Not so good as last
year’s, maybe, but—”</p>

<p>“Hope not!” laughed Jimmy. “You beat us
badly last year. How do you fellows happen to
be so far from home?” Mount Millard was at
Warren, and Warren was some eighteen miles
from Alton.</p>

<p>“We came over to go to the dentist’s,” the boy
explained. “There isn’t a decent one in Warren.”</p>

<p>“Nor anything else,” mourned his companion.</p>

<p>“Except the school,” said Jimmy smilingly.</p>

<p>“Sure, the school’s all right, but there aren’t
any decent stores there. It’s a hole that way.”</p>

<p>“Where do your crowd buy your athletic supplies,
then?”</p>

<p>“Oh, one of the druggists keeps a few things.
Generally he sends away for them.”</p>

<p>“How long did it take you to get over here?”
Jimmy asked.</p>

<p>“About twenty-five minutes, I guess. We came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
in an automobile with a man who lives there. It
takes about forty minutes by the trolley.”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh,” responded Jimmy thoughtfully.
“Don’t see why you fellows can’t do your shopping
over here.”</p>

<p>“Well, it isn’t worth while, I guess. We manage
to get most everything we want, one way or
another.”</p>

<p>“Rackets like this one?” asked Jimmy, smiling.</p>

<p>The boy shook his head, smiling, too.</p>

<p>“Tell you what I’ll do,” announced Jimmy.
“We give a ten per cent discount to Alton fellows
and I don’t see why we shouldn’t give the same
to Mount Millard. You may have that racket for
five dollars and sixty-two cents. All I ask is that
you tell fellows where you bought it and that if
they’ll take the trouble to come over here—or
send over, if they like—we’ll treat them white and
give them ten per cent discount from the regular
price. What do you say?”</p>

<p>The boy hesitated, but the space of that hesitation
was so brief as to be almost negligible.
“I’ll take it!” he said crisply.</p>

<p>When they were gone, hurrying off to their appointment
at the nearby dentist’s, Jimmy smiled
proudly as he took out a pen and began to figure
on a piece of wrapping paper. “‘b.j.t.,’” he
murmured. “That’s 6, 5, 0. I was only a quarter
of a dollar out of the way. All right. Now, ten
per cent off that leaves—let’s see—yes, five-eighty-five.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
He counted the money on the counter:
a five dollar bill and sixty-two cents in change.
Then he figured once more. “I owe twenty-three
cents,” he muttered, and found the amount in his
pocket and added it to the sum on the counter.
Then he reached beneath for the cigar box and
swept the proceeds into it, with an air of intense
satisfaction not at all marred by the fact that
the sale of the tennis racket, because he had translated
the price-tag’s inscription erroneously, had
cost him personally twenty-three cents!</p>

<p>That transaction satisfactorily completed,
Jimmy went, whistling, back to the doorway to
again play the rôle of the watchful spider. The
tune he whistled evidently did not please Mr. J.
Warren Pulsifer who had left his cage and was
listlessly arranging a bunch of asparagus fern in
the wax-papered bottom of a long card-board box.
As he worked he shot impatient, even indignant
glances at the unconcerned Jimmy, who, not realizing
the pain he was inflicting on the florist’s
nerves, went heedlessly and blithely on. It is just
possible that, even had he realized the discomfort
his melody was causing, he would have continued
it, for Mr. Pulsifer didn’t stand very high with
Jimmy.</p>

<p>Others came and looked into the window, some
interestedly, some carelessly, and all ultimately
passed by. The better part of an hour passed.
The sunlight became very warm, and Jimmy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
looked longingly across the street toward the
screen door of the Blue Front Pharmacy from
behind which came the hiss of carbonated water.
Jimmy wanted a cooling drink very much. But
duty held him sternly at his post. If, he warned
himself, he were to cross the street even for a
scant three minutes some one might enter the
store in his brief absence and, finding none to
wait on him, go away again. Besides that—and
Jimmy glanced at his watch—Rus Emerson had
promised to run over at ten to see how he was
getting on, and it certainly wouldn’t do to be missing
when Rus arrived! Tiring of watching the
street, Jimmy went back behind the counter.
There was no chair there, which he thought
showed a sad want of interest, on the part of his
employers, in his comfort, but he found that it
was possible to squeeze a scant portion of his
anatomy against the boxes on the lowest shelf and
maintain his position there by bracing his feet
against the edge of the counter. He had just got
himself satisfactorily settled when the doorway
was darkened and an anxious voice hailed him
above the tramp of hurrying footsteps.</p>

<p>“Where’s the tennis racket?” called Russell
anxiously.</p>

<p>Jimmy dropped his feet and came upright very
promptly. “Tennis racket?” he repeated. “<em>The</em>
tennis racket? If you mean—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>“I mean the one in the window,” interrupted
Russell excitedly. “It’s gone!”</p>

<p>“Oh, that!” replied Jimmy casually. He
brushed an invisible speck from a sleeve and
smiled boredly. “We sold that.”</p>

<small>JIMMY’S DAY</small></h2>
</div>


<p>True to his word, Steve Gaston used Russell
more gingerly on Tuesday, and Russell, who was
still aching in many places, was grateful. Just
the same, he was not entirely satisfied when, after
a twenty-minute practice line-up between the two
scrub squads, the second crossed the field to the
first team gridiron and he made the discovery that
it was Tierney who was to play right end. It
takes more than a few pains to reconcile your
enthusiastic football player to the bench—or, in
this case, the sod. And yesterday’s short taste
of the game had reawakened all of Russell’s old
ardor. But he wasn’t to be quite neglected, for
in the middle of the second twelve-minute period
of battle Tierney was laid low, with every bit of
breath eliminated from his body, and Gaston sent
a quick call across the field for Russell. Back in
the game, facing the redoubtable Captain Proctor
or warily watching Crocker, at left end on the
enemy team, Russell forgot his aches and entered
lustily into the fray. Crocker proved a troublesome
opponent that afternoon, for the first was
trying out a “bunch forward” in which, when
the play was made to the left, Crocker and Harmon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
and Browne participated, or sought to. Russell,
aided by Reilly, had an anxious and breathless
time of it. It is to their credit, though, that
the “bunch” succeeded but twice and then on the
other side of the field. First scored but once to-day,
and only after a blocked kick on the scrub’s
thirty-six yards, when Putney, the first team right
tackle, grabbed up the bouncing pigskin and marvelously
dashed through half the enemy forces
and planted it behind the line. The second had
two tries at goal from the field, and Kendall
missed both. On the whole, however, the second
was fairly well satisfied with the afternoon, and
even Gaston looked as though he spied a glint of
hope in the clouds of adversity.</p>

<p>That evening Russell’s thoughts turned wistfully
toward a nice clean cot in the school infirmary,
and every time he moved he groaned
either in spirit or very audibly, depending on
whether or not he was alone. Yet life held its
cheering aspects, for Stick had jubilantly reported
three sales during the afternoon, which, combined
with Jimmy’s sale of the tennis racket, brought
the day’s business up to the colossal sum of thirteen
dollars and eighty-three cents, a sum hitherto
never even approached. Jimmy came in after
supper and the three talked the matter over in
detail and with much enthusiasm. Stick forgot to
be pessimistic and swung to the other extreme.
His sales had been to high school fellows, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
had discovered that there were two hundred and
twenty-two of them in this year’s enrollment and
proceeded to prove, to his own satisfaction at
least, that the high school students were due to
enrich the firm of Emerson and Patterson to the
tune of one dollar and eighty-seven cents, net,
every day until the middle of next June.</p>

<p>“I guess,” said Russell when that fact had been
thoroughly demonstrated by the very earnest
Stick, “that that advertisement we put in the high
school paper fetched those fellows. It might be
a good plan to keep it running.”</p>

<p>But Stick didn’t see that. Advertising cost a
heap of money, and now that the ball had been
started rolling there wasn’t any sense in going
on with it. “Those fellows will tell other fellows,”
he asserted, “and that’s the best sort of
advertising there is.”</p>

<p>“We are advertised by our loving friends,”
quoted Jimmy.</p>

<p>Russell agreed to discontinue the high school
advertisement, but he was firm for going on with
the one in <cite>The Doubleay</cite>, and Stick dubiously
agreed to that wasteful course. Jimmy described
once more with great gusto the details concerning
the sale of the tennis racket—they laughingly
referred to it as “the” racket, since it had been
the only one in stock—and predicted that much
trade would accrue from Mount Millard School
as a result of his brilliant acumen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>“We might,” began Russell, “put an ad. in their
paper—” But Stick’s unhappy frown cut him
short, and he dropped the subject and turned
back to Jimmy. “You keep talking about six and
a quarter,” he said perplexedly. “You mean six
and a half, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Eh? Oh, the price of it! Yes, yes, six and a
half. I was thinking about the discount, I guess.”</p>

<p>“But the discount brought it to five-eighty-five.”</p>

<p>“Yes, well—you see, I’m an awful ass at figures,”
answered Jimmy desperately. Not for
worlds would he have had Russell know that he
had mulcted himself of that twenty-three cents!</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t know what you think about it,
Stick,” said Russell, “but I believe Jimmy has
brought us luck!”</p>

<p>And Stick, rather unwillingly, agreed.</p>

<p>And as time went on that conviction strengthened
with Russell. By the end of that week business
had picked up enormously at the Sign of
the Football. There had come a letter from
Mount Millard ordering “one of those rakets like
George Titus bought from you resently,” and as
the money was enclosed Russell didn’t find it incumbent
on him to criticize the spelling. High
school boys were frequent visitors in the afternoons.
They didn’t always buy, but those who
didn’t spread the news and others came in their
places. Another football had found its way to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
the Academy, and more and more Altonians were
learning to enter under the alluring sign rather
than to proceed a few doors further to the more
pretentious House of Crocker. All this was vastly
cheering to Russell and to Stick, and hardly less
so to Jimmy, who, if not one of the firm, was nevertheless
fully as interested in the success of the
business as either of the others. Sid Greenwood
had dropped in one morning when Russell was
there and had looked and talked and pored over
catalogues, and it was already an assured fact that
the Sign of the Football was to have the patronage
of the Basket Ball Team. And Bob Coolidge
had broadly hinted but a few days later that it
would be a good plan for Russell to put in a few
sample hockey sticks and skates and so on; and
Russell had duly ordered. Ordering was a regular
daily performance now. Fellows were very
good-natured about waiting a day or so, which
was certainly fortunate, for only occasionally as
yet did the store have just what was wanted!
Russell or Stick or Jimmy would open an empty
box, out of sight of the customer, frown, put it
back, open a second and then shake his head.
“Sorry, but we haven’t your size,” he would announce
apologetically, or, “We’ve sold the last
one.” Always, though, such a remark was invariably
followed promptly by a reassuring:
“They’re on order and will be along to-morrow.
If you don’t mind dropping in about half-past four<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
it’ll be here.” The New York train that carried
the noon mail and express reached Alton at four.
It took only fifteen or twenty minutes to get the
goods from the post office or express company,
and at four-thirty the customer went away contentedly.
There was a slim black-covered book
behind the counter and into this the orders went,
and some time before six o’clock Russell would
take himself to the telephone office and call up
the New York dealer. Seldom did the dealer disappoint
him.</p>

<p>Money was coming in now, but money was also
going out, and the balance in the firm’s name at
the bank was growing very slowly. Stick frowned
often and darkly at the size of the orders that
were despatched to the city and still more darkly
at the checks drawn in settlement for them. But
even Stick’s economical brain couldn’t find any
way of selling goods without ordering them or of
ordering them without ultimately paying for them.
Meanwhile Jimmy was becoming a salesman of
ability, to say nothing of poise. Jimmy had a way
of selling a nose-guard as though it were a diamond
set in platinum, and no purchaser of so
small an item as a tennis ball went away without
feeling that he had been treated like a person
of importance and had somehow unintentionally
managed to get the best of the transaction.</p>

<p>Russell’s aches left him gradually and by the
end of that week he had fairly beaten out Tierney<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
for the position at the right end of the second
team line. The first team found their daily opponent
a harder and harder proposition, and on
Friday, for the first time, the scrimmage ended
without a score for either side. To be sure, only
one twelve-minute period was played, but even
so—</p>

<p>The big team made its first trip away from home
the next day and played Lorimer Academy. Lorimer
had last year held Alton to a 3 to 3 tie, and
an easy contest was neither expected nor found.
At the end of the first half the opponents were
even, with a touchdown and goal each. In spite
of the story told by the score, Alton had showed
rather better work, and the ball had, save for one
brief and regrettable period, remained in Lorimer
territory. The regrettable period had occurred
at the beginning of the game, when, receiving the
ball on the kick-off, Lorimer had brought it back
to Alton’s forty-one yards. That unexpected feat
had quite nonplused the visitors and during the
next series of plays they showed that it had, for
two gains had been made through the left of their
line for a first down on the thirty-yard line.
From there, following an attempt at Putney that
yielded a scant stride, Lorimer threw forward to
the fifteen-yard line where an unwatched half-back
caught and, although chased down by Harley
McLeod, managed to fall across the last line mark
just inside the boundary. There was some discussion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
as to whether the runner had not gone out
before he got the ball over, but the officials gave
him the benefit of the doubt. Lorimer kicked the
goal easily.</p>

<p>After that Alton had pulled herself together,
quickly wrested the pigskin from the enemy and
taken the offensive. There was, though, no score
for her until the second period was well along.
Then a long, hard march from the center of the
field to Lorimer’s eighteen yards culminated in a
series of smashing attacks on the enemy’s left by
Harmon and Moncks, and on the seventh play the
ball went over. Captain Proctor kicked the goal.</p>

<p>When the third quarter started Lorimer showed
the benefit of the rest and, possibly, of the coach’s
tuition. She kicked off to the Gray-and-Gold and
her ends spilled Ned Richards on his ten-yard line.
After two running plays that failed to advance,
Alton punted to Lorimer’s forty. Lorimer pulled
a trick play that went for twelve yards around
the opponent’s left end. A jab at the center was
wasted and her quarter punted diagonally to
Alton’s eight yards where Harmon gathered in
the ball but was forced outside after a few strides.
The pigskin was too near home for comfort, and
Ned Richards stepped aside in favor of Browne
on second down and Browne punted to midfield.
Again Lorimer tried a quarter-back kick and
again gained. Ned Richards, waiting for the ball
to bound over the goal line for a touchback, saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
it change its mind erratically and start back up
the field. He fell on it finally near the five-yard
line, with, by that time, most of the Lorimer forwards
hovering about him.</p>

<p>Alton decided to kick on first down, and Browne
stepped back behind the goal posts. Nichols
passed low and the full-back punt was necessarily
hurried. The ball sailed high in the air and
descended near the twenty-yard line, and the Lorimer
back who caught it very carefully stepped outside,
since there was no chance for an advance.
The pigskin was stepped in and Lorimer found
herself in the fortunate position of being in possession
of the ball on first down on the enemy’s
nineteen yards. A fake attack to the left, with
left half running to the right took the ball to the
center of the field, although for no gain. Lorimer
prepared for a placement kick from close to
the thirty yards, but the pigskin was taken by
quarter through Stimson for two. Again, on
third down, the same preparations were carefully
gone through with, and this time the ball went
back to the kicker, instead of the holder, and then
was hurled through the air to where, one foot over
the goal line, an end had stationed himself. It
was a pretty pass, well concealed, well thrown and
well caught, and although Harmon brought down
the catcher promptly the touchdown was accomplished.
Again Lorimer kicked the goal.</p>

<p>Alton was chagrined and rather angry. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
very evident that, since her defense against the
opponent’s forward passing game was not good
enough, the opponent must not be allowed again
within scoring distance of the goal. It was extremely
trying, extremely exasperating to be twice
scored on by a team who was plainly unable to
gain consistently by rushing! Coach Cade seized
the interim following the goal to remove Crocker
from left end and to substitute Rhame and to put
Johnson at right tackle in place of Putney who was
showing the battle. The third period ended in a
punting duel between Browne, for Alton, and
Snow, for Lorimer, and when the teams changed
sides it was Alton’s ball on her thirty-four yards.</p>

<p>There was then a slight advantage in the possession
of the south goal, for a breeze had arisen
since the beginning of the half and was blowing,
at moments quite strongly, toward the other end
of the field. Austen had replaced Harmon, and
to Jimmy was handed the task of using that breeze
to work the team’s way inside the enemy’s first
defenses. As a prelude, Moncks took the ball and
managed to batter through left guard for four
yards. Then Jimmy punted and, getting height,
saw the breeze take a hand in his effort and add a
good ten yards to the kick. Rhame was on the
catcher almost before the ball had landed in his
arms. Lorimer tried two attempts outside tackle
and then punted in turn. But Alton had gained
nearly ten yards on the exchange, and, after a first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
down that netted barely a yard gain, Jimmy again
stepped back and, the Gray-and-Gold line holding
well, punted with his customary deliberateness
and again got more than fifty yards. This time
Lorimer ran the pigskin back across one white
line before she was stopped. Lorimer recognized
the futility of pitting her punter against Alton’s
in the circumstances, but, with her back to her
goal, there was no help for it after two desperate
rushes had been stopped for five yards, and again
the ball sailed off. This time the kick was weak
and Appel, who had just relieved Richards, caught
it on Lorimer’s forty-seven yards and, feinting
and twirling, cut across the field with it, found
open territory for a moment and sped along to the
thirty-five before his meteoric career was stopped.</p>

<p>That proved the result that Alton had sought.
From the thirty-five yards to the twenty she went
in four rushes. There she was slowed up and a
short forward pass, Browne to McLeod, was used
as a last resort and did the business. After that,
with a small coterie of devoted Altonians begging
for a touchdown, the result was not long in doubt.
Still smarting over her indignities, Alton hammered
and thrust, and, reaching the six yards in
two downs, hurled Moncks past left tackle for half
the remaining distance and then literally piled
through the center of the Lorimer line and deposited
Appel and the ball well over the last mark.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Mart Proctor missed the goal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
miserably, and the handful of Alton supporters
groaned. Lorimer was still one point ahead and
the time was getting short. Captain Proctor gave
way to Butler and Linthicum went in for Browne.
During the remaining minutes several more
changes were made in the Alton line-up, so that
when the last whistle blew the Gray-and-Gold presented
a thoroughly second-string appearance.</p>

<p>Lorimer fought for time now, fought to keep
the opponent away from scoring territory, punting
even on first down and against that breeze.
But she didn’t have many chances to put boot
leather to pigskin, for Alton was through with the
kicking game. Lorimer was beatable by surer
methods, and Alton returned to rushing. Twice
her backs got almost free around the Lorimer
ends and once Linthicum found a barn-door opening
in the center and staggered through for twelve
yards. With the time-keeper’s watch showing
something less than two minutes left, the ball was
Alton’s on the home team’s thirty-six. Appel held
a whispered conference with Rowlandson, who had
succeeded to the captaincy, and then sprung a surprise.
Linthicum was sent back to kicking position
and, since a field-goal would win the game
for Alton, Lorimer never doubted that, with the
time nearly up, a drop-kick would follow. But
Jimmy Austen got the ball when it left center and
Jimmy found as many holes in front of him as
there are in a sieve and proceeded to ooze through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
one of them. And, being through, he kept right on
oozing, just how no one, least of all Jimmy, could
have afterwards told. But he oozed faster and
faster. In fact, the ooze became a trickle and then
a spurt, and, escaping a tackle here and dodging
an enemy there, turning, twisting, as elusive as a
drop of quicksilver, Jimmy somehow kept going
straight for the goal and somehow got there, got
there without having been once tackled, got there
through the whole enemy team and with never a
bit of aid from his own side! And, having got
there, Jimmy put the ball down, hunched his
shoulders and philosophically and even smilingly
bore the useless onslaught of the infuriated enemy.</p>

<p>It didn’t matter that Rowlandson missed the
goal. No one expected him to make it, certainly
not Rowlandson, for he was no goal expert and,
as he put it, became the goat only for lack of some
one better qualified. He managed to send the ball
between the posts, but only because the line of
discouraged opponents hadn’t enough interest left
to put up a hand and stop it!</p>

<p>There was one more kick-off and four more
plays, and then the game was over. Every fellow
loves a hero, and so, for quite a week, Jimmy
Austen wore the laurels. And doubtless he deserved
them, although, as Jimmy explained often
enough during the next forty-eight hours, no one
but a cripple could have failed to make that touchdown!
“Their old line was full of holes,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
Jimmy. “They were all set for a try-at-goal and
came pouring through as soon as the ball was off.
All I had to do was hug the old turnip and let
’em by. Then I side-stepped a couple and took it
across. There’s no sense in making a fuss about
it!”</p>

<p>But they did—for a while. In football there’s a
new hero, of larger or smaller caliber, every week
or so, and Jimmy’s fame only lived until the Hillsport
game the following Saturday, when Ned Richards
sprinted sixty-odd yards for the score that
evened up matters in the third period and turned
what looked horribly like defeat into a 6 to 6 tie.</p>

<small>MR. CROCKER CALLS</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Russell didn’t see the Loring game, although
there was no second team practice that afternoon
to prevent. Instead he took Stick’s place in the
store, allowing that youth to put in an afternoon
at tennis, the only kind of physical exertion he approved
of. Russell was glad that he had done this
long before closing time arrived, for he spent a
very busy time at the Sign of the Football. There
was one heart-stirring quarter of an hour when,
by actual count, seven customers lined the counter!
Russell surreptitiously counted the throng
a second time, incredulously certain that he had
overestimated. Even femininity invaded the store
when two high school girls came in search of
sweaters. Russell, always shy in the presence of
the opposite sex, was all thumbs when it came to
displaying his wares and, for the first time, wished
that he had not relieved Stick. Stick wouldn’t be
disturbed in the least by the whole female population
of Alton! Nothing, pursued Russell in his
thoughts, as he clumsily brought a pile of boxes
crashing down on his head, ever did disturb Stick
much except an attack on his pocketbook.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>The two young ladies were extremely self-possessed
and viewed Russell’s embarrassment with a
sort of kindly contempt. The boy’s first hopeful
announcement that they carried no girls’ sweaters
failed of the effect he desired. They did not, they
explained calmly, want girls’ sweaters, but boys’
sweaters. After that there was nothing for it but
to display wares, falteringly explain why the garments
were priced half a dollar higher than similar
garments purchased by the fair customers in
New Haven two years before and resist a horrible
temptation to wipe the perspiration from his
brow. Russell heaped the counter high with boxes—some
of them, of course, empty—and got very
much mixed in the matter of sizes and prices. In
the end, when the shoppers severely declared that
they would take two of the sweaters but couldn’t
think of paying the price set for them, Russell
weakly but, oh, so gladly knocked off a quarter
of a dollar, almost frantically wrapped the parcels
up, overlooked a discrepancy of a nickel in one
payment, and, had not courtesy forbade, would
have joyously pushed them out the door.</p>

<p>When they were at last gone, he wiped his forehead,
sighed deeply with heartfelt relief and wondered
if it would not be a good idea to hang a card
in the window with some such inscription on it as
“Gentlemen Only” or “No Females Need Apply”!
After that he sold a pair of woolen hose
to an Alton chap and two tennis balls to a tall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
bespectacled gentleman who, Russell suspected,
was the “Painless Dentist” further down the
street. The hour for closing was nearing and Mr.
J. Warren Pulsifer, who had been leaning in a
sort of trance over his books in the wire cage since
four o’clock, moved and sighed loudly. Then
followed business of locking a drawer with much
jangling of keys, the clanging of the cage door
and the florist set his hat on his head, looked dubiously
at the single light in the further window—Mr.
Pulsifer never lighted his window—took three
boxes from the glass-fronted case at the back of
the store and passed out with a dismal “good
night.” Those three boxes, which, Russell concluded,
Mr. J. Warren Pulsifer was going to deliver
in person, appeared to constitute the day’s
business of the florist’s establishment. Russell
wondered whether it was possible that the dejected
gentleman made money over his expenses. It
didn’t seem that he could, for the few orders that
came to him surely did amount to more than thirty
dollars a week. Russell’s thoughts were still on
Mr. Pulsifer when the doorway was darkened by
a large, thickset man in a suit of black and a wide-brimmed
felt hat of the same color. When he came
into the light from the window Russell recognized
him.</p>

<p>“Good evening, Mr. Crocker,” he said politely.</p>

<p>Mr. Crocker replied affably and then looked
curiously about him. “Your name’s Emerson, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
take it,” he said finally. “Nice little establishment
you’ve got here.”</p>

<p>Russell agreed, although he saw quite plainly
that the visitor didn’t think it a nice little establishment
at all, that, on the contrary, he had
viewed it rather contemptuously.</p>

<p>“Thought,” continued the hardware merchant,
“I’d stop in and have a word or two with you.”</p>

<p>“Very kind, I’m sure,” murmured Russell.</p>

<p>“Well, I’m an old hand at the selling game, Mr.
Emerson, and I’ve learned one or two things you
haven’t—yet. You’re young and, I guess you
won’t mind my saying so, inexperienced.”</p>

<p>“Not in the least, sir.”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” pursued the other, interpreting the
boy’s reply to suit himself. “Now I’m always
glad to help young fellows like you who are just
starting out for themselves. I’ve done it many
times. Us older men mustn’t forget that we owe
a duty to youth and inexperience. That’s why I
dropped in, Mr. Emerson.” Mr. Crocker had
thrust his hands into the pockets of a pair of capacious
trousers and was observing Russell smilingly
across the counter. “Now you and I are in
the same line of business, partly. That is, you
sell athletic supplies and so do I. Of course, it’s
a small part of my business, but I’m not hankering
to lose it. Not,” added Mr. Crocker, quickly,
“that there’s any danger of that. I’ve always
welcomed competition, Mr. Emerson. There’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
plenty of trade here for you and me both if we
handle it right.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” affirmed Russell.</p>

<p>“Yes, but cutting prices isn’t going to get us
anywhere.” Mr. Crocker smiled almost playfully.
His was a leather-grained, deeply-furrowed countenance,
and that arch smile looked extremely out
of place. “No, sir.” He shook his head gently
but emphatically. “No, sir, my young friend,
cutting prices is bad for us. You cut and I cut
and what’s left? Neither of us is making a profit.
I’m not in business for pleasure, and neither are
you, I take it. Now, the best thing for both of us
is to come to a sort of friendly agreement. As I
said before, there’s trade enough for us both, and
there’s no sense in throwing away our profits.
That’s sense, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Perfect sense, Mr. Crocker. But I haven’t
been throwing away my profits, so far as I know,
sir.”</p>

<p>“You’ve been selling goods ten, fifteen, twenty
per cent under the usual local prices,” replied
Mr. Crocker firmly. “I manage to keep tabs on
what’s going on around me, my friend.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been selling goods at prices that bring
me a fair profit, Mr. Crocker, a profit that I’m satisfied
with. Of course, it costs me less to do business
than it costs you, sir, but that’s nothing for
me to worry about.”</p>

<p>The hardware man looked searchingly at Russell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
and stiffened. “You’ve been cutting prices
to get my trade, young man,” he announced severely.
“I’m here to tell you it’s got to stop. I
came in here like a friend, but I’m going out an
enemy if you persist in taking that tone with me.
Don’t think I’ll let you get my business away from
me, sir, because I won’t. It’s been tried before.”
Mr. Crocker’s face hardened and his voice was
grim. “Four years ago a fellow opened up right
over there, where Whitson is now. He lasted
eight months. Then the sheriff sold him out.
There’s been others, too. You take my advice and
think it over. Why”—Mr. Crocker’s gaze traveled
disparagingly over the shelves and the little
show-case—“why, you haven’t enough stock here
to run three weeks if you were getting any business.”</p>

<p>“In that case, why worry, sir?” asked Russell.</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m not worrying! That’s up to you.”
Mr. Crocker smiled again, but the smile was more
like a snarl. “You think it over. That’s my advice
to you. You think it over and then drop
around to see me about Monday. There’s no reason
why you and I shouldn’t come to an agreement
on prices, Mr. Emerson. I’m willing to come
down a little here and there. I’ll be fair. We
can fix it so’s you’ll make a bigger profit than
you’re making now—if you’re making any; which
I doubt—and won’t lose any of your trade. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
you don’t decide to be reasonable, why, you’d
better look for another line of business!”</p>

<p>Mr. Crocker settled his hat more squarely on his
head, nodded curtly and went out. When he had
gone Russell put out the lights and locked the
door, all very thoughtfully. The thoughtfulness
continued while he strode quickly to State street
and thence made his way to the Green and to
Upton Hall. In Number 27 he recounted briefly
to Stick the conversation with Mr. Crocker. Stick
was fairly aghast.</p>

<p>“I knew something rotten would happen,” he
groaned. “I knew the luck was too good to hold.
Well, I guess there’s only one thing to do.”</p>

<p>“That’s all I see,” agreed Russell as he hurriedly
prepared for supper.</p>

<p>“And maybe,” went on Stick, a wee bit more
hopefully, “he’s right, Rus. Maybe we’ll do just
as well if we charge a little more for things. I
suppose it is rather cheeky for us to open up almost
next door to the old codger and try to undersell
him. In a way, it was fairly decent of him to
give us a warning, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps. But wasn’t it sort of a confession
of weakness, Stick?”</p>

<p>“I don’t get you.”</p>

<p>“Why, if he really thinks he can put us out of
business, why should he come and offer us a part
of the trade? Why not take it all?”</p>

<p>“I suppose he wanted to be fair,” answered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
Stick, doubtfully. Then he started and shot an
anxious look at his companion. “Look here,
Rus,” he exclaimed, “you’re—you’re not thinking
of acting the fool!”</p>

<p>“Hope not. Depends on what you mean by
acting the fool.”</p>

<p>“I mean you’re not going to try to buck him,
are you?”</p>

<p>“I guess you could call it that,” answered Russell
easily. “At least, I don’t propose to let
Crocker or any one else come and tell me—”</p>

<p>“But you can’t do that!” wailed Stick. “I’m
as much interested in that store as you are—almost,
and—and I won’t have it! We can’t afford
to make an enemy of that fellow, Rus. He’ll do
just as he told you and we’ll be broke in a month.
There’s no use in being stubborn. Of course, it
isn’t pleasant to have him dictating to us, but he’s
got the whip-hand, now hasn’t he?”</p>

<p>“He may have, but I doubt it.” Russell gave
a final pat to his tie and glanced at the little clock
on his chiffonier. “Come on and let’s eat, Stick.
We can talk about this later.”</p>

<p>Stick, however, chose to talk about it all the
way to Lawrence and would have talked about it
during supper had Russell given him an opportunity.
But Russell dived into general conversation
and left his partner to silent and moody meditation.
Stick was so thoroughly alarmed that he
ate almost nothing; and Stick’s appetite was normally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
something to be proud of. Afterwards the
subject was returned to and the two came nearer
to a quarrel than they ever had before. Only the
fact that Russell refused to get angry prevented
it. Stick pleaded and begged, argued and, at
length, commanded, but Russell was not to be
moved.</p>

<p>“We agreed,” he said firmly, “that, as I had
put more money into this than you had, I was
to have the say in such matters as this. And I’ve
thought it over carefully, Stick, and I mean to
go right on as we’ve been going. Look here, now.
Suppose we agreed to Crocker’s plan. We make
an agreement with him not to sell goods below a
certain price. He had all the trade before and
he will have it all again. He says there is business
enough for both of us. That listens well,
but it isn’t true. Our only chance of making good
lies in getting a whole lot of trade away from him
if we can do it. And we’re doing it. And that’s
what’s worrying him. He’s been selling things at
a big profit, just as though the War hadn’t ever
stopped, and there’s been no one to interfere with
it. Now we come along and put a fair price on
our goods and, of course, we’re getting customers
away from him. Every day some one comes in
and says, ‘Why, Crocker asks fifty cents more than
that,’ or sixty cents, or whatever it may be. He
realizes that he’s either got to scare us into an
agreement on prices or lower his own prices; yes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
and put better goods in stock, too! He hates to
get less than he’s been getting, and so he tries
to frighten us. Well, he can’t do it. We don’t
frighten. As for driving us away, why, he will
find that we’re hard to drive, Stick. He simply
can’t do it.”</p>

<p>“That’s all well enough to say,” replied Stick
desperately, “but how do you know he can’t?
Suppose he lowers his prices below ours? Then
what happens? Why, folks go to him, of course,
and we sit and whistle. And then the rent comes
due and a lot of bills come piling in and—bingo!
good-by, Football!”</p>

<p>“Crocker will have to cut a lot below our prices,
Stick, to get any trade away from us. In the
first place, we sell better stuff. You know that
yourself. Then we treat customers a heap better,
and we know our stock. But, if we do begin to
slip, we’ll cut prices, too. We can play that game
just as well as he can.”</p>

<p>“No, we can’t! He’s got all sorts of other
goods to sell, and we haven’t. He could run his
sporting goods department at a loss for months
and not have to worry!”</p>

<p>“He would worry, just the same,” said Russell,
smiling. “I know Crocker’s sort. He’d worry if
a clerk sold a five cent screwdriver at less than
ten! But never mind that. Those P. and F. folks
are after business, Stick. They’re making a hard
drive to introduce their goods here in the east,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
and, I think, they’re having difficulty. The other
folks are fighting them for every inch. Now if I
run over to New York and tell them that Crocker
is cutting prices on rival goods they’ll stand back
of us, I’ll bet. They’ll sell to us at prices that’ll
let us meet Crocker and go him one better.”</p>

<p>“That’s what you think,” sneered Stick. “You
always think what you want to think, Rus. That’s
your trouble. You’re too blamed optimistic. I’d
rather hear the P. and F. folks say so before I
banked on it!”</p>

<p>“They’ll say so when the time comes,” replied
Russell cheerfully. “But I don’t believe it will
come.”</p>

<p>“I know you don’t,” said Stick disgustedly.

<small>ALTON SQUEEZES THROUGH</small></h2>
</div>


<p>It was after the Hillsport game that the slump
began. The first team seemed to fairly droop under
the shock of that unexpected reverse; for to
be played to a tie by that opponent was virtually
no less than a defeat. Last year, even on Hillsport’s
own field, Alton had easily beaten the other
by 14 to 0, and for years past Hillsport had gone
down in defeat, often ingloriously. On this regrettable
occasion, however, the enemy had honestly
earned her touchdown by outrushing Alton
all through the first two periods and, finally, by
old-fashioned smashing tactics, pushing across for
a score. Had Hillsport possessed a more adept
goal-kicker she might have departed with a victory.
Ned Richards’ scurry down the field for
Alton’s touchdown in the last moments of the third
period had been a splendid piece of individual brilliancy,
and it had, in a measure, saved the day for
the Gray-and-Gold, but there was no blinking the
fact that all of Alton’s efforts to gain through the
Hillsport line had failed and that against a heavy,
fast-working, clever team the Gray-and-Gold had
showed up rather miserably. All this, realized by
the onlookers, had not been lost on the players<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
themselves, and the effect of the knowledge seemed
to be paralyzing. The team promptly passed into
what Captain Mart feelingly termed a “forty below”
slump. Coach Cade sweated and scolded
and planned and pleaded, and all through the following
week the second pushed and tossed the big
team about the gridiron with an amazing lack of
respect. The second, awaking to the evident fact
that the opponent was not, after all, invulnerable,
took revenge for past abuse and aspersion and
bullied and maltreated the first eleven brutally.
In this reprehensible course they were aided and
abetted, nay, even encouraged, by one Steve Gaston.
Steve had no mercy, or, at least, showed
none. The second jestingly referred to the daily
scrimmage as the “massacre.” “Come on,” Captain
Falls would blithely call. “Let’s go over and
finish ’em up, second!” Now all this was fine
for the morale of the second, as was speedily
proved. Success, instead of spoiling them, improved
them. It welded them more firmly together
just as, doubtless, a successful sortie by
the Robber Barons of the Rhine in the old days
produced an increased <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de corps</i>. Probably
a career of crime, such as the second was now
following, is like that. Anyhow, Steve Gaston
secretly rejoiced as he incited his desperadoes to
greater atrocities.</p>

<p>The first didn’t take their drubbings meekly, you
may be sure, but they took them. They took them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
three times that week. They almost cried at some
of the indignities put upon them by an awakened
and merciless scrub, and they fought back desperately
and staged many “come backs” that
never developed, and the School, attracted by the
novel, well-nigh incredible spectacle of a first team
being baited and beaten by a second, flocked to the
field of an afternoon as for a Roman holiday.
They didn’t always see the helpless victim devoured
by the ravening lion, for twice the victim
forgot his rôle and held the lion at bay, and once—that
was Friday—even sent him cringing back
to his lair, defeated! But in any case the spectators
got their money’s worth in thrills.</p>

<p>It would be nice to be able to say that Russell
was the bright particular star of the second, but
he wasn’t anything of the sort. Russell didn’t
aspire to be a star, and maybe he couldn’t have
been, anyway. Besides, Steve Gaston didn’t hold
with stars. He discouraged them as soon as they
lifted their heads into sight. His idea of a good
football team was one in which eleven men acted
as one man and in which none stood out above
his fellows. Steve’s slogan was “Fight!”</p>

<p>“I don’t care,” he would say, “how much football
a fellow knows if he won’t fight. He’s no use
on this team. Football’s fighting, from first to
last. Keep that in mind. The fellow who fights
hardest wins. Fight fair, but <em>fight</em>. Some of
you chaps act as if you thought you were in this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
to let the first slap your face and get away with
it. You’re not, by gumbo! You want to forget
that the first team fellows are members of the
same frat! They’re your enemies from the moment
the whistle blows, and your business is to
everlastingly whale ’em. Beat the tar out of ’em!
Knock the spots off ’em! That’s football. That’s
the game. The harder you use those fellows, the
harder they’ll use Kenly. Paste that in your helmet!”</p>

<p>Russell took Steve’s earnest commands with a
grain of salt; wherein he was wrong, for Steve
meant all he said. Russell liked football and liked
to play it hard, just as he liked to do anything else
he attempted, but he retained all through that unprecedented
week a sneaking sympathy for the
first. Probably others of his mates did also, even
if they dissembled the fact most successfully.
Russell made his mistake in not thoroughly dissembling,
which is why there was a knock on his
door that Friday evening and Coach Gaston entered.</p>

<p>As was his way, Steve got to business at once.
“I’ve been watching you playing pretty closely
this last week, Emerson,” he began, settling into
a chair, “and I’m curious. Thought I’d come
around and have a little talk with you. Now, suppose
you tell me, first off, just what you think the
matter is.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>“Matter?” echoed Russell. “What is the matter?”</p>

<p>“You tell me,” answered the coach. “I’ve seen
fellows who could play and fellows who couldn’t
play—a lot more of the last kind than the first,
you bet!—but it’s sort of out of the ordinary to
find a fellow who can play and doesn’t. Must be
a reason, of course, so I thought I’d ask you.”</p>

<p>Russell looked every bit as puzzled as he felt.
“But I don’t get you, Gaston. Are you—do you
mean <em>me</em>?”</p>

<p>Gaston nodded. “Of course. You’re the man.
If it’s a private matter, Emerson, and you’d
rather not let me in on it—”</p>

<p>“But I <em>am</em> playing, Gaston! I don’t understand
what you mean!”</p>

<p>“Yes, you’re <em>playing</em>, and I guess that’s the
trouble. Maybe some one’s clipped your claws,
eh?”</p>

<p>Russell couldn’t have said whether Gaston’s
tone had been sneering or not, but he flushed as he
answered warmly: “If you mean that I’m not trying
my hardest and doing my best—”</p>

<p>“Uh-huh, that’s it,” replied the coach easily.
“Why don’t you?”</p>

<p>“But I tell you I am!”</p>

<p>Gaston smiled gently and shook his head. “No,
you’re not, Emerson. Maybe you think you are,
but you’re not. You go through the motions very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
nicely. You follow the ball as closely as any of
the fellows, you sense plays well and you handle
yourself finely. But you always hold something
back, son. I’ve seen it time and again. To-day,
for instance, you let Crocker get around you
twice, and you tackled Austen on one play there
as though you thought he was made of glass and
might break in the middle.”</p>

<p>“I stopped him,” protested Russell.</p>

<p>“Sure, you stopped him! But, man alive, don’t
you know that he was carrying the ball? Don’t
you know that a smashing hard tackle will sometimes
make the runner drop the ball? I’ve seen
a college game won by the team that tackled the
hardest. Sooner or later a runner will get a
jar that’ll send the ball out of his arms. It
doesn’t happen often, but it does happen, and
it’s worth counting on, Emerson, for games have
been won before now because of a fumbled
ball.”</p>

<p>“But I don’t want to kill any one!”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about that. Players don’t get
hurt by hard tackling, beyond a bruise or two.
It’s because we count on hard tackles and stiff
blows that we train for the game as we do. No
fellow who learns to take a fall the right way gets
anything broken. Emerson, you can’t play football
and consider the other fellow’s feelings. Now,
as I’ve said, I’ve watched you, and I like your
style, but, by gumbo, son, you’re not doing yourself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
justice! And you’re not playing fair by me!
You’ve heard me tell the team over and over that
when the game starts those other chaps aren’t
friends of ours, they’re the enemy. And the
enemy is something to lick! I don’t care if the
man playing opposite you shares your room here,
Emerson. When you’re playing against him he’s
just as much your foe as if he wore the red K
on his sweater! Funny I can’t drill that into you
chaps. I’ve tried hard enough!”</p>

<p>“Seems to me,” said Russell, “that’s carrying
it pretty far.”</p>

<p>“No, it isn’t. You think a minute. What are
we in business for? To give practice to the first
team, eh? Sure! All right. Now suppose we’re
a poor lot. What’s the result? First gets feeble
opposition. She walks through us, holds us for
downs, fools us on plays, out-punts us. She gets
the notion that she’s pretty good and is right
pleased and cocky. Then she runs up against a
real team and gets knocked into a cocked hat.
What good’s that?”</p>

<p>“I know all that,” acknowledged Russell, “but
we aren’t that bad, Gaston.”</p>

<p>“Of course not, but don’t you see the point?
We’re here to do our honest, level best, Emerson,
to fight hard every minute, to show the first that
she’s just a bunch of mutts, to knock her down
and rub her face in the mud and teach her to fight,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
<em>fight</em>! That’s our part in licking Kenly next
month. That’s our share of the big moment. The
better we are, the better the first will be.”</p>

<p>Russell sighed. “Maybe that’s all true, Gaston,
but it doesn’t seem to me that we have to
play like muckers to do our share.”</p>

<p>“Muckers! Gosh, no! But there’s nothing
muckerish in playing hard. Hard playing isn’t
dirty playing, Emerson. I’ll chuck any fellow on
the second who plays dirty, and do it before the
umpire can open his mouth. But I want my
men to give me everything they’ve got, Emerson.
When they give it to me they’re giving it to the
School. Next month you’ll sit and watch the big
team wallop Kenly, and you’ll say to yourself:
‘Some team that, some team! And I helped build
it! I blamed near wore myself out, and maybe
I won’t get the last bandage off before Christmas,
but it was worth it! That’s my team that’s winning,
and I taught it how!’ Well, I must be going.
There’s a conference at Johnny’s in ten minutes.
Think over what I’ve said, Emerson. Good
night.”</p>

<p>And Steve was gone, having wasted no time on
ceremony.</p>

<p>Russell did think it over, during the ensuing
few minutes before Stick came in and, later, when
the light was out and he was curled up in bed.
He knew that Gaston was right, and before he
went to sleep he had determined that the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
team coach should never again have cause to reproach
him for holding back. Maybe Gaston took
the whole thing too seriously, but that was up to
Gaston. Russell’s duty was to obey orders.</p>

<p>The first journeyed to New Falmouth the next
day and played High School. New Falmouth was
a manufacturing town and the High School bunch
was a very husky aggregation of youths who
played the game of football earnestly and in a
manner that doubtless won the warm commendation
of Steve Gaston. It is possible, though, that
they sometimes allowed their enthusiasm to lead
them into devious ways, for there was much penalizing
that afternoon and some cautioning, and if
further proof was needed there was Nichols’ ensanguined
nose and Mart Proctor’s extremely discolored
eye! The game was lacking in science but
not in interest, for it see-sawed back and forth as
the twelve-minute periods passed and neither the
goodly army of Alton supporters or the much
larger assemblage of enthusiastic and strongly
prejudiced New Falmouth cohorts dared predict
a victory for its team. At the end of the first
quarter Alton was in the lead, 6 to 0. When the
half was done the teams were tied at 6 to 6. When
the third period had passed into history, the Gray-and-Gold
was once more trailing, for again New
Falmouth had scored a touchdown, without, however,
adding a goal to it. At the final tooting of
the horn Alton was victorious by the narrow margin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
of one point, the complete score being 13 to 12.
Mawson, succeeding where Mart Proctor had
previously failed, had added the deciding point
amidst the hostile howls and shrieks of the enemy.
After that five minutes more of play had failed to
alter the figures.</p>

<p>Alton had certainly not done herself proud, but
she derived some joy from the victory and returned
home with the notion that she had got her
feet back on terra firma once more and that, come
Monday, she would show that second team that it
couldn’t bite her and get away with it! That was
the team’s notion. The School wasn’t nearly so
set-up, while Coach Cade, although he kept his
own counsel, was not unduly optimistic. That
slump was still hanging around, as the day’s game
had shown, and he didn’t look for an immediate
departure. Such maladies as that which held the
Alton football eleven in its grip are mysterious
and difficult to conquer. They must run their
course, although that course may be shortened by
skillful handling of the case. Having tried heroic
measures for a week, Coach Cade now decided to
try opposite methods. On Monday there was no
work for any of those who had taken part in the
New Falmouth game, and, consequently, no scrimmage
with the second. On Tuesday the work was
light, and again there was no meeting with the
scrubs. The latter were chagrined and insulting.
The first didn’t dare face them, they declared.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
Johnny was afraid to have them hurt. As a result
of such charges there were two mix-ups between
first and second team players, one in the
locker-room that was halted this side of bloodshed,
and one which was said to have gone four full
rounds to no decision. The latter was held back
of Haylow and witnessed by an appreciative audience
in nearby windows. Neither affair did anything
towards fostering that spirit of forbearance
so deplored by Steve Gaston!</p>

<p>Meanwhile, from Kenly came bright reports of
the Cherry-and-Black team, and Alton Academy
settled down into deep pessimism on the subject
of the big game. This, it was clear, was not to
be an Alton year. Youths of literary proclivities
wrote indignant letters to the school weekly—a
few of which were published—and wherever two
or more were gathered together the invariable
subject of discourse was What’s the Matter with
the Team? In such unsatisfactory way the early
season passed and the Mount Millard game
loomed closely ahead.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII</a><br />
<small>STICK CONFIDES HIS TROUBLES</small></h2>
</div>


<p>On Wednesday of that week Crocker’s Hardware
Store had announced in the paper a twenty
per cent reduction in the price of athletic goods.
Also, as Jimmy had discovered that morning, one
window of Crocker’s had been devoted to a display
of football supplies and a general athletic
miscellany. Rather an attractive window it had
been, too, although the dresser had evidently experienced
some difficulty in finding sufficient articles
with which to fill it, since he had eked out
with canoe paddles, baseball bats and a lunch
hamper. Jimmy had reported the matter with
some concern to Russell and that morning and the
mornings following had spent a large part of his
time at the front door prepared to accost any person
looking like a prospective buyer of athletic
goods before he could get as far as Crocker’s.
But Russell had not seemed greatly worried, and
events proved that he had had no reason for
worry. If there was no great growth in trade
at the Sign of the Football, neither was there any
perceptible falling off; and Jimmy, who kept a
sharp watch on the rival establishment, reported<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
that so far as he could determine Crocker’s was
getting no more custom than usual.</p>

<p>Even with that twenty per cent discount it was
doubtful if Crocker’s prices were yet lower than
those of the Sign of the Football, and until they
were Russell saw no reason for lowering his own
prices. Stick spent a miserable week, fearing
financial ruin and doing surreptitious figuring on
scraps of paper. Russell was never allowed to see
those figures, but he could guess what they meant.
Business was really good now, and as the days of
that week passed without any lessening of it Stick
was almost encouraged to take hope. But it took
a great deal to make Stick optimistic and he was
still lugubrious when Saturday came. Russell
sought to cheer him up by displaying figures that
represented the week’s sales and the net profits,
but Stick only viewed them moodily and sniffed.</p>

<p>“Crocker hasn’t started on us yet,” he said.</p>

<p>Russell who had toiled hard and whole-heartedly
for the last three days at the task of teaching
football to the first team wanted very much to see
to-day’s game. Nevertheless he would not have
asked Stick to take his place in the store, since it
had become understood that on Saturday afternoons
Stick was a gentleman of leisure. But it
was Stick who proposed it. He didn’t care much
about football, anyway, he observed, and if Rus
wanted to see the game he, Stick, didn’t mind looking
after business. So Russell thanked him and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
hurried off at three o’clock in an effort to reach
the field for the kick-off.</p>

<p>An hour later, the Mountain having failed to
come to Mohammed, Mohammed put on his black
felt hat, left his store and walked a few doors
southward. Secretly he was incensed, outwardly
he was unperturbed and even genial. His geniality
increased when he found the junior partner
instead of the senior presiding behind the counter
in the Sign of the Football. He introduced himself
to Stick, and Stick replied warily that he was
glad to meet him, not being anything of the sort.</p>

<p>Mr. Crocker found the junior partner quite a
different proposition from Russell. Stick was uneasy
and showed it. There was none of Russell’s
confident defiance about him. Mr. Crocker leaned
against the counter and talked about weather,
trade, the Academy and again trade. He impressed
Stick vastly, which was just what he intended
to do. Stick lost some of his discretion
and it wasn’t long before the caller was in possession
of the knowledge that Stick regretted his
financial connection with the Sign of the Football,
although Stick didn’t say so in so many words.
Mr. Crocker gave it as his frank and disinterested
opinion that there had been a great mistake
made when the Sign of the Football had been
opened for business. He quoted figures to Stick,
figures showing that it had never paid Mr. Crocker
to carry athletic goods and never could pay him.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
There was not, he confided, sufficient trade in the
town. Only the fact that those who came to purchase
athletic goods returned for hardware or
related articles sold by Mr. Crocker induced him
to continue in the sporting goods business. That
sounded reasonable and Stick nodded.</p>

<p>Mr. Crocker suggested that being a junior partner
wasn’t very satisfactory, anyhow, since you
didn’t have an equal voice in the conduct of business,
and again Stick nodded. Mr. Crocker was
fast proving himself a man of discernment and
wisdom. It is an odd fact that your extremely
suspicious person—and that Stick Patterson
surely was—can be readily fooled if the right intelligence
undertakes the job. Look around and
see if I’m not right. Stick reversed his opinion
of Mr. Crocker in something under thirty minutes.
He no longer thought him base and designing. On
the contrary he saw now that Russell’s picture of
the hardware merchant had been quite out of
drawing and that Mr. Crocker was a kind-meaning,
well-intentioned gentleman whose seeming interference
in their affairs was actuated by honest
and sympathetic motives. In short, Mr. Crocker
saw from his long experience the fate awaiting
the unfortunate venture of the Sign of the Football
and, having the Golden Rule ever in mind, was
doing what he could to avert it. Having accepted
that estimate of the caller and his errand, Stick
became confidential.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>Ten minutes later Mr. Crocker, patting his soft
hat more firmly on his head, remarked: “Well, if
your partner can’t be made to see the wise thing
there’s nothing I can say or do, Mr. Patterson.”
He smiled kindly and sorrowfully as he moved
toward the door.</p>

<p>“I suppose not,” assented Stick gloomily.
“Gee, if I could get out of it—”</p>

<p>“Yes, you might do that,” said Mr. Crocker
carelessly.</p>

<p>“Eh?” exclaimed Stick. “How could I?”</p>

<p>Mr. Crocker turned a slightly surprised countenance
over his shoulder. “Why, sell out, of
course,” he said.</p>

<p>“Oh!” replied Stick disappointedly. “I’m
willing enough but Russell hasn’t got the money.
He says he may have it later, but—”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe,” said Mr. Crocker, pausing
and looking thoughtfully through the door, “that
your partner would be willing to give you more
than you put in for your share of the business.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t expect him to,” said Stick. “I’d
be glad to get my money back!”</p>

<p>“You ought to do a little better than that,”
asserted the man. “In fact, I wouldn’t be surprised
if you could sell at quite a neat little profit,
Mr. Patterson.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe so, sir. By the time Rus gets
ready to buy me out there won’t be any business
left, I guess.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>“I agree with you, but why wait so long? Why
not sell now?”</p>

<p>“He won’t buy now,” answered Stick, a trifle
surprised at Mr. Crocker’s density.</p>

<p>Mr. Crocker waved a hand carelessly. “Some
one else might,” he said. Stick stared.</p>

<p>“You mean that—that you—”</p>

<p>“Dear me, no,” protested the other. “I
wouldn’t touch it for half what you put in, Mr.
Patterson. You see, I know the business. But
there may be others who don’t.”</p>

<p>“I guess there wouldn’t be any one who’d care
to buy,” said Stick. Mr. Crocker, he thought,
was a bit visionary for a man seemingly so hard-headed.</p>

<p>“Possibly not, possibly not,” Mr. Crocker returned.
“Still, if I should hear of any one looking
for a small investment of the sort I’ll take
the liberty of letting you know. If it isn’t too
much of a secret, Mr. Patterson, what does your
interest here amount to?”</p>

<p>Stick hesitated. The sum was, of course, ridiculously
trifling from the point of view of a person
of Mr. Crocker’s wealth. But Stick finally gave
the figures, nevertheless. Mr. Crocker’s brows
raised incredulously.</p>

<p>“But your partner must have put in very much
more then!”</p>

<p>“Only about seventy-five more,” denied Stick.</p>

<p>“You mean to tell me you’ve been doing business<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
here on a capital of something under four
hundred dollars?” exclaimed Mr. Crocker. “Astounding!
Ridiculous!”</p>

<p>“It was all we had,” replied Stick defensively.</p>

<p>“H’m. Well, you won’t have so much to lose,
anyway,” said the other cheerfully. “That’s fortunate,
eh?”</p>

<p>“A hundred and twenty-five’s a lot more than
I want to lose,” answered Stick earnestly. “If
you hear of any one who will pay that much, sir,
I wish you’d let me know.”</p>

<p>“I will, certainly. In fact, Mr. Patterson, I’ll
make inquiries. Perhaps, though, we’d better
keep this to ourselves for the present. For instance,
I wouldn’t mention it to your partner just
yet. Time enough when we have a buyer, eh?
For that matter, maybe it’ll be just as well if
Mr. Emerson doesn’t learn of my call. Between
you and me, Mr. Patterson, he seems to have taken
a—er—well, a dislike to me.” Mr. Crocker smiled
patiently and forgivingly. “He might, you see,
object to losing your interest, which, doubtless, he
hopes to acquire himself when he is quite ready.
Perhaps he figures that by spring, say, the business
will be so run down that your interest can be
purchased for less than you’d be willing to let it
go for now.” Mr. Crocker shook his head sadly,
in the manner of one who, during a blameless life,
has watched the devious ways of less upright persons.
“Well, I’ll be going,” he continued. “Very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
glad to have met you, Mr. Patterson, and to have
had this talk. It is always a pleasure to meet a
reasonable and sensible person. Good afternoon.”</p>

<p>After the caller had gone Stick had one or two
qualms of doubt. Had he done right in letting
Mr. Crocker so far into the secrets of the business?
Would it be fair to sell out his interest to
any one save his partner? Still, if Rus couldn’t
buy, and another could—</p>

<p>Stick had plenty of food for thought during the
rest of the day.</p>

<p>Russell watched the Mount Millard game from a
comfortable seat in the grandstand and heroically
joined his voice to the voices of some three hundred
and seventy-five others during four hectic
periods. For neighbors he had Stanley Hassell
and Bob Coolidge, those young gentlemen having
spied Russell making an eleventh-hour search for
a seat, hailed him and in some mysterious manner
wedged him in between them. No matter how
much difficulty Bob Coolidge might experience in
ordinary conversation, when it came to cheering
he was all there. There was no hesitation, no stuttering,
and his voice was like unto the voice of the
Bull of Bashan. But had every Altonian there
that afternoon possessed Bob’s vocal powers it is
doubtful if the outcome of the game would have
been much different.</p>

<p>Russell saw the enemy hold the home team<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
scoreless throughout the first quarter, when, with
the wind in her favor and all the luck of the game
with her, the Gray-and-Gold struggled valiantly
and desperately to cross the enemy’s goal-line and,
twice reaching the fifteen yards, was halted and
turned back. It was in that period that Alton
played her best game, although the fact wasn’t
known then. In the second quarter, with the wind
behind her, Mount Millard punted and kept on
punting until, near the end, her chance came.
Then Crocker, who seemed to have definitely won
the left end position from Rhame, shooting around
the opposite end of the Alton line with the ball,
was met head-on by a watchful enemy back and
in the shock of that collision let go of the pigskin.
When the whistle again piped the pigskin lay
twelve yards nearer the Alton goal and a Mount
Millard lineman sprawled protectingly above it.
That was the enemy’s opportunity, for the line-up
was on Alton’s thirty-two yards and the brisk
wind was blowing straight toward the Alton goal-posts.
Mount Millard tried two rushes that added
four yards more to her possession and then, amidst
a deep silence, sent her left halfback to kicking
position for the third consecutive time. This time,
as friend and foe alike knew, there was no pretense
about it. A minute later the ball had sailed
lazily across the bar and Mount Millard had
scored.</p>

<p>But three points seemed as yet nothing to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
worry about. Stanley Hassell predicted that after
Johnny had got through reading the riot act in
there—nodding backward toward the gymnasium—the
home team would come back and bite large
and gory holes in Mount Millard. Bob Coolidge
agreed thoroughly if stutteringly and only Russell
remained pessimistic. Russell had noted the first
team’s let-up in that second period, had seen the
signs before and interpreted them correctly as
subsequent events proved. Alton never again
during the remaining twenty-four minutes of actual
playing time showed herself dangerous. The
third quarter was all Mount Millard, even if she
didn’t score. For Alton, who had taken a leaf
from her opponent’s book and was kicking on second
down, Jimmy Austen performed creditably
enough, but what he managed to gain on his punts
the enemy stole away by running back the ball for
ten, fifteen, occasionally twenty yards. The Alton
ends were heavy-footed and slow, tackled the
wrong man and, when they had picked the right
one, generally missed him. Rhame went in for
Crocker and Lake for McLeod, but little improvement
resulted. In the line Alton at times seemed
half asleep. The men charged high and slow, and
on defense it was only the secondary army that
saved the day a dozen times. Mount Millard
paved the way for a touchdown in the final minutes
of the third quarter and secured it soon after
the last period had begun. Then a short forward-pass<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
took the ball to the Gray-and-Gold’s twenty-seven
yards, a long-legged halfback skirted Lake
for six and Mount Millard formed for a try-at-goal.
None expected it and it didn’t materialize,
but again Mount Millard edged closer, this time
by a full-back sprint. The enemy made it first
down on Alton’s sixteen, and from there, although
Coach Cade threw in almost a new line from end
to end, took the ball over in four plays, the last
of which went for three yards through an utterly
demoralized defense.</p>

<p>Mount Millard kicked the goal and made the
score 10 to 0, and then set to work to further humiliate
the opponent. And she would have done
so, there is no doubt, if the last trump hadn’t
brought the game to an end just when it did. For
Mount Millard was again well inside Alton’s last
defenses and coming hard.</p>

<p>Bob Coolidge remarked sadly as they made their
way down the aisle that, anyway, ten to nothing
wasn’t as bad as nineteen to nothing, which had
been the score of last year’s win for the visitor.
But neither he nor his hearers appeared to derive
much comfort from the thought!</p>

<small>NOT IN THE GAME</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Sunday morning at school is always a time of
reckoning. On Saturday events are likely to succeed
each other too swiftly to give one time for reflection
or realization, and when bedtime comes
sleep arrives quickly to a tired body. But Sunday
is different. There is that added half-hour of
slumber, the later and more leisurely breakfast at
which one eats a little more heartily than on weekday
mornings, the following period of repletion
and calm, and, subsequently, a long day interrupted
by few duties. Under such circumstances
even the least thoughtful are given to thought,
even to introspection. Yesterday’s events, the
events of the week, present themselves to the
mind, pleasurably or otherwise, insisting on consideration.
Even consciences have been known to
stir on Sunday morning!</p>

<p>This particular day of reckoning brought one
realization to each and every fellow at Alton,
which was that the football situation was desperate.
Some phrased it one way, some another,
but that was what they meant. The team was
variously described as “punk,” “shot full of
holes” and “sunk without trace.” Certain morbid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
youths took to figuring the size of the score
that Kenly Hall School would roll up against her
helpless opponent. The figures ran all the way
from 10 to 0 to 36 to 3. The youth accountable for
the latter prediction explained that 3 by stating
that even so implacable an enemy as Kenly would
let Mart Proctor put over a field-goal under such
circumstances, seeing that it was Mart’s last game
and everything! But there were many who felt
that the youth in question was unjustifiably optimistic.</p>

<p>How Coach Cade felt about the situation I don’t
know. No one did know, probably, unless, possibly,
it was Captain Mart. The coach never wore
his heart on his sleeve, and his sharp dark eyes
saw much more than they told. It was no secret
that there was a conference in the coach’s room
that Sunday night that lasted well after ten
o’clock, but those who attended it gave out no
news. Rumors, of course, were rife. Mart Proctor
had resigned the captaincy after a falling-out
with Johnny. Coach Cade had resigned after a
row with Captain Proctor. They were going to
scrap the first team, all but one or two fellows,
and play the second against Oak Grove and Kenly.
Hurry calls had been sent to all quarters of the
East for assistant coaches. Ned Richards and
Mart were at outs because the latter had taken the
running of the team away from Ned in the last
quarter yesterday. These were some of the wild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
rumors that circulated through the school on Sunday
and Monday. There were others, but they
were less sensational, and so less popular.</p>

<p>On Monday, however, things looked much as
usual on the field. There were no cuts allowed,
even those who had sustained injuries being out.
The hospital list was also in evidence to a man;
Neirsinger, with his neck swathed in bandages,
Nichols with his left shoulder under leather, Harmon
with a right ankle sporting much silk elastic,
Smedley looking sad and pale after a ten-day bout
with bronchitis; and one or two others. But they
were all there, and while a few did no more than
look on most of them performed at least some
slight labor. There had been a short but earnest
talk in the dressing room before practice and the
members of the team had worn more serious countenances
than usual when they had reached the
field.</p>

<p>Contrary to the usual procedure, the second
team was called across at half-past four and lined
up against a first eleven consisting largely of second-string
players. They looked easy to the
scrubs, and the latter visioned another jolly massacre,
but something went wrong with their vision.
With Coach Cade and Captain Mart driving as
mercilessly as in a mid-week scrimmage, that
patched-up first eleven got together as no first
eleven had for a fortnight and gave the scrubs the
fight of their lives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>Russell had no difficulty that afternoon in following
Coach Gaston’s injunction and forgetting
that the opponents were Altonians. Butler, who
played left tackle in Proctor’s place, erased all
merciful tendencies from Russell’s mind shortly
after the first clash when he sent a none too heavily
padded elbow against the opposing end’s face,
an all-encompassing attention that set his head
ringing, almost jarred his teeth loose and, proceeding
further, put his nose temporarily out of
plumb. Of course, it was quite accidental. That
is to say, Butler held no personal animosity
toward Russell. He would have done the same no
matter who had been playing scrub end. Perhaps
Russell should have taken that into consideration
and felt better about it. But there wasn’t much
time for judicial consideration of anything, and
so, occasionally removing the sanguine evidence
with a sleeve, he forgot that Butler was a school-mate,
a neighbor in Upton Hall, a brother member
of the Debating Society and a good fellow generally,
and, in football parlance, proceeded to
“smear” him. So successful was he that Appel
soon stopped sending plays at that end—greatly
to Wells’ chagrin, a chagrin he didn’t hesitate to
voice—and the two deadly opponents did more
glaring than battling. That was a pretty struggle
while it lasted, and it was watched enjoyably by
non-combatants and approvingly by Coach Gaston.
When the trouble began again after the first no-score<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
period and a five-minute breathing spell it
was Mart Proctor who occupied left tackle position
on the first and Russell’s supremacy was at
an end. Not that he allowed Mart to walk over
him often, however. Russell played real football
that Monday afternoon, and his deeds were respectfully
spoken of afterwards. He and the passionate-spoken
Wells formed on defense an outer
guard that turned back most invasions.</p>

<p>Coach Cade whipped and spurred and the first
fought as it hadn’t fought for two weeks and
more. One by one the substitutes were withdrawn
whenever possible and first-string men took their
places, and there was a last whirlwind, breathless
five minutes that took the ball half the length of
the field and landed it under the scrub’s goal.
There, spurning half-measures, Ned Richards,
who had replaced Appel, sought to drive across.
A field-goal would have been possible, easily possible
from the eighteen-yard line, but a touchdown
was still something that the first was incapable of
against a team which, like the scrubs, had been
fed for a fortnight on victory. Coach Cade
stormed and thundered, Captain Mart shouted encouragement,
Ned Richards scolded and goaded,
and each time the second team gave back grudgingly,
growlingly a scant yard or two yards. It
was fourth down on the thirteen yards, with five
to go, and Ned took matters into his own hands.
A fake forward by Linthicum, standing well back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
of the line, the ball to Ned instead, a moment of
delay and concealment, and then a lightning dash
inside tackle on the right. It was Goodwin who
stopped the runner barely on the eight yards.
There was doubt about the distance and talk of
measuring, but the second team captain pushed
the hesitant official aside.</p>

<p>“Let ’em have it!” he said hoarsely, defiantly.
“Sure, they made it!” He silenced a protest from
the red-headed Reilly sharply. “Now let’s see ’em
get over! Come on, Second! Show ’em who we
are! They don’t know they’re up against the
<em>real</em> team!” There was insult in that emphasis,
and the first growled angrily. But the second
laughed proudly and exultantly and lined up inside
the eight yards and drew in their breaths
deeply. Then came the onslaught once more.
Mawson tried to get through Captain Falls and
made less than a yard. Moncks tried the other
guard position and made nothing. The first
snapped into a shift and Linthicum edged back
up the field. The second crossed to meet it. Russell
went out and back. The ball passed, was
gone from sight. A sudden massing of the scrubs
at the left of center. A muddy helmet was lifted
above the mêlée, was poised there an instant and
went back and down. The scrubs pushed in. A
whistle blew.</p>

<p>“Fourth down!” panted the referee. “About
ten to go!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>First had lost its scant gain!</p>

<p>Second howled raucous derision, taunted as it
dug its cleats again. But first team had shot its
bolt. A field-goal or a forward pass alone remained
to her, and she tried the latter. It was
Russell who took that pass five yards behind his
goal-line and under the nose of the desperate
Crocker, and it was Russell who sank gently down
on the sward and, with the ball carefully beneath
him, stifled a groan. For the disappointed
Crocker had signified his feelings by a quick, hard
blow to Russell’s already damaged nose.</p>

<p>In the tense excitement of the instant the blow
had gone unseen, or unrealized, by most. But
Wells had seen it and Wells acted quickly. Billy
Crocker measured his length beside the goal-post,
while first and second players rushed up, expostulating,
threatening, eager for trouble. For the
moment none remembered Russell, and that youth
presently crawled to his feet with the ball, dabbed
ineffectually at his bleeding nose and became
aware of the fact that internecine strife was
threatening a few yards away. But the coaches
and the managers and the captains and one or two
other exponents of peace dug their way into the
group and begged and commanded and threatened,
pushing and shoving here and there, and
war was averted. Above all other voices could
be heard the strident tones of the indignant and
blood-thirsty Wells.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span></p>

<p>“He poked Emerson square in the nose, the
dirty bounder! I saw him do it! Let him come
over here and try it on me! Yah, you’d better
get him away, Mart!”</p>

<p>Then Coach Cade and one or two more were
questioning Russell and Russell was shaking his
head negatively. “I’m sure it was an accident,”
he asserted. “I’m satisfied.”</p>

<p>“He’s lying!” shouted the irrepressible Wells,
struggling between his captors. “He’s lying!”</p>

<p>So the scrimmage ended.</p>

<p>Russell didn’t go over to the Sign of the Football
that afternoon when he left the gymnasium.
Jake had rendered first aid to his swollen and extremely
painful nose, but Russell didn’t quite
fancy parading that disfigured feature in public.
Stick appeared slightly peeved when he got back
to the room, but a glimpse of his friend’s countenance
seemed to restore his good humor, or so,
at any rate, Russell thought. Stick received a
brief and bald narrative of the affair, voiced as
much sympathy as he ever voiced over the misfortunes
of any one but himself and put the matter
aside.</p>

<p>“Kincaid was in this afternoon,” he announced.
Mr. Kincaid was the Physical Instructor.
“Wanted prices on a lot of gymnasium stuff;
dumb-bells, eight pairs of clubs, a punching-bag—quite
a lot of things. I brought the list back.
Told him we’d let him know to-morrow.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>“But you could have figured the prices easily
enough with the catalogue,” protested Russell
troubledly. “He will think we’re a funny bunch
if we have to hold a conference before we quote
him prices!”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, but we’ve got to remember
that Crocker’s got everything marked away down,
Rus,” replied Stick placatingly. “If we want to
get this sale we’ll have to beat Crocker, I guess.”</p>

<p>“Do you think he went to Crocker’s, too?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. He didn’t go that way when
he left the store, but he may have been there
first.”</p>

<p>“Well, we’ll give him the regular prices with
the regular discounts,” said Russell. “Let’s see
the list.”</p>

<p>Stick produced it and Russell ran his eye down
the typewritten memorandum. The list was surprisingly
long and represented a very neat profit
for the seller. Russell pulled a pad of paper to
him and began to figure tentatively, appealing to
Stick at intervals when memory failed him. But
Stick answered at random and seemed little interested
in what, three weeks ago, would have been
a stupendous affair. Russell wondered. Had
Stick informed him of the conversation on Saturday
with Mr. Crocker he might have understood
his partner’s indifference, but Stick had been very
careful to make no mention of that.</p>

<p>After supper, a meal somewhat marred by many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
jocular allusions to his nose, Russell hurried to
West street, avoiding as much as possible the
lighted stretches. Not for several weeks had he
been to the store in the evening, and when, expecting
to find the premises dark, he saw a dim
light burning within, his first feeling was of uneasiness.
Nor was his uneasiness lessened when
he found the door locked. But once inside he saw
that there was no occasion for alarm. Behind
the iron grilling of the desk sat Mr. Pulsifer, his
startled countenance dimly illumined by the single
light.</p>

<p>“Hello,” greeted Russell cheerfully. “I didn’t
expect to find you here, sir, and thought of burglars
or something when I saw the light.”</p>

<p>“I—I sometimes come here at night,” answered
the florist hesitantly. “I was—er—looking over
my books.”</p>

<p>Russell went back of the counter and found the
catalogue he had come for, all the time aware that
Mr. Pulsifer was following him with a perturbed
gaze. Evidently, thought Russell, he was not
wanted there, although it was hard to believe that
Mr. Pulsifer’s occupation was so important as
to cause him to resent intrusion. “If,” continued
Russell to himself, “it was me, I’d be mighty glad
to have some one come in to speak to! The old
chap looks sort of down on his luck to-night.”</p>

<p>When he had said good night and gone out,
locking the door behind him, his thoughts continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
with Mr. Pulsifer. “Queer old codger, anyway,”
he reflected. As a matter of fact, the florist
was not really old, but he did give the impression
of being so. “Wouldn’t be surprised if he went
flooey some day and we had to either move or
take the whole store. He can’t be making any sort
of a living. Wonder if he has a family to support.
Hope not. They must be starving, for all the
money his business brings in. Well, I don’t wish
him any hard luck, but I’d just as lief have a
change of landlord. He sort of gives me the
creeps!”</p>

<p>When he got back to the room Stick was gone,
but Jimmy was awaiting him. “Thought I’d drop
around and ask after the jolly old proboscis,”
said Jimmy. “How’s it feeling?”</p>

<p>“If,” replied Russell with dignity, “you are
referring to my nose, it is feeling punk. How
does it look?” He forgot his dignity and was
frankly anxious. Jimmy viewed it from various
angles, his head on one side. Finally:</p>

<p>“Strange and—ah—quaint,” he answered. “It—it’s
sort of spread, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Feels as if it was all over my face,” replied
Russell, laughing. “Well, Jake says it will return
to its usual graceful outlines in a day or
two.”</p>

<p>“Possibly,” murmured Jimmy, “possibly, but
I can’t conceive it. What have you got there?” he
added, nodding at the catalogue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>Russell explained. “You’re just the fellow I
wanted, too, Jimmy. Sit down over there and give
me a hand with this. I’m going to get these prices
to Mr. Kincaid to-night.”</p>

<p>Jimmy sighed as he took the indicated place and
accepted the catalogue from Russell. “I came to
tender sympathy,” he said, “and remain to toil.
All right. What’s the first item?”</p>

<p>Twenty minutes later Russell departed for Borden
Hall and Mr. Kincaid, and, left to himself,
Jimmy settled down on his spine and picked out
in the catalogue a great many articles that he
meant some day to acquire, a favorite diversion
of his in moments of leisure at the store. He knew
that catalogue quite thoroughly now, from end to
end, but he still found it interesting. He had
spent something over a hundred dollars, in imagination,
by the time Russell was back, looking very
pleased and satisfied.</p>

<p>“Find him?” asked Jimmy, laying the catalogue
down.</p>

<p>Russell nodded. “I guess we get the order, too,
Jimmy. He didn’t say so. Said he would have
to consider the prices a bit. But he was awfully
nice and said we deserved encouragement and—and
all that.” Russell thrust his hands in his
pockets and beamed down on Jimmy. “There’s
more than forty dollars of clear profit in that bill
of goods!”</p>

<p>“Great! Say, do I get a raise of salary?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, if we make that sale you get fifteen cents
a week.”</p>

<p>“Gosh!” Jimmy was plainly awed. “What’ll
I ever do with it?”</p>

<p>They talked over the afternoon’s events then.
“You put up a corking game, Rus,” declared the
visitor. “I was watching you and Butler, and I’ll
say that Butler had nothing on you, son. Say,
you’re playing lots better football than you did
last year, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>Russell reflected. “Yes, I think I am,” he answered.
“Steve Gaston’s a crackajack coach,
Jimmy. He has a way of showing you how to do
things that—oh, I don’t know, but he just says
a couple of words and makes a motion and—and
you get him! Yes, I really do think I’ve improved.
Fact is, last year there didn’t seem to
be any great whatyoucallit—incentive to do very
much. You know that yourself. We just went
over and let the first team whale us five days a
week and that’s all there was to it. This year it’s
lots different. We—”</p>

<p>“I’ll say so! This year you just go over and
whale the first! Well, I’ll acknowledge that you
guys have quite a team there. I’ll hand it to you.
Also to Steve. He’s a regular, raging, rampageous
tiger these days. Seems as if he’d like
to get us all laid up in the hospital and then die
happy.”</p>

<p>“Steve says the harder we use you fellows the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
harder you’ll use Kenly,” said Russell, grinning.</p>

<p>“Yes, and we’re going to use you fellows hard
before we get to Kenly,” answered Jimmy
warmly. “Believe me, Rus, there’s some kick in
the old team yet, and in a day or two more you
guys will be sorry you took advantage of our enfeebled
condition—”</p>

<p>“Well, who enfeebled you?” laughed Russell.
“It was the little old second that put the skids
under you.”</p>

<p>“Nothing of the sort,” answered Jimmy indignantly.
“Look at the hospital list we had!”</p>

<p>“You didn’t have any hospital list until we gave
you one!”</p>

<p>“Say, you fellows hate yourselves,” said Jimmy
wearily. “Anyway, you’re due for an awful
shock pretty quick!”</p>

<p>“Sooner the better,” replied the other, cheerfully.
“Then we’ll know that all our toil hasn’t
been in vain. I don’t mind saying that teaching
football to you mutts is pretty hard work, and
I’ll be glad when it’s over.” Russell felt tenderly
of his nose.</p>

<p>“I guess you’ll be looking on to-morrow,” said
Jimmy, grinning.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t know. This thing will be a lot
better by morning. I wouldn’t wonder if I was
back on the job again, giving a few more pointers
to you fellows.”</p>

<p>“Looks to me as if the old pointer was a bit out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
of commission,” Jimmy laughed. Then: “Say,
Rus, I wish Johnny’d swipe you for our team. I
don’t see why he doesn’t. You’re as good as that
wild ass Crocker. Better, I believe. Or you would
be if you were in fast company for a week or so.”</p>

<p>“Fast company!” groaned Russell. “Oh, my
sainted aunt!”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, son. We may be going a
little slow just now, but when we go back into high—watch
our dust!”</p>

<p>“Watch you <em>in</em> the dust, you mean,” retorted
Russell. “No, thanks, Jimmy, I get all the excitement
that’s good for me now. And unless you
fellows really take a brace in the next week it’s
going to be a bigger thing to have been on this
year’s second than on the first!”</p>

<p>“Something in that, too,” acknowledged Jimmy
ruefully. “Say, what do you take it is the matter
with us, anyway?”</p>

<p>Russell shrugged and frowned. “Blessed if I
know,” he said. “You started out pretty well and
went nicely until you struck Hillsport. That
seemed to take all the starch out of you.”</p>

<p>“That’s right: we’re sort of rough-dried now.
Maybe old Johnny can put the starch back into
us, though. I’d hate to finish out here with a licking
by Kenly. I wouldn’t mind if I had another
year.”</p>

<p>“I suppose you’ll play in the Kenly game,” said
Russell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>Jimmy nodded. “Bound to for a while. Of
course, it’s hard luck having fellows like Harmon
and Mawson on the same job, but Harmon won’t
last the game; he plays too hard; and Mawson
can’t punt much. Oh, yes, you’ll doubtless see
little James rushed on in the last quarter to pull
the game out of the fire.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t mind being in that game,” said
Russell reflectively.</p>

<p>“Of course you wouldn’t! Even if you lose you
don’t forget that you’ve been through one of the
big hours of your life. Gosh, if something happened
and I didn’t get in I’d just lie down and die,
Rus!”</p>

<p>“And if you do get in you’ll probably die just
the same, only more painfully! They say that
Kenly’s got a rip-snorting team this year.”</p>

<p>Jimmy shrugged. “They say that every year—until
we’ve licked them. Still, I do think they’re
rather better than usual. And that’s sort of rotten,
for we’re about half the team we were last
year. Between you and me, old son, I guess we’re
in for a drubbing. It’s against orders to say that,
or even think it, but it’s my honest belief. Oh,
well, we’ll make ’em work for it! And there’ll be
some gorgeous and hectic moments before the old
Gray-and-Gold is counted out! Besides, ding bust
it, you can’t always tell, Rus. The under dog has
won the battle before this! Well, see you to-morrow.”</p>

<small>STICK FINDS A BUYER</small></h2>
</div>


<p>The first team worked its way slowly out of
the Slough of Despond that week. Progress was
not uninterrupted, to be sure, but it seemed certain
enough. On Tuesday the first took slight
revenge on the scrubs, but on Wednesday it
slipped back a little, allowing the second to give a
spirited imitation of its former high-handed
methods. Thursday again saw the first team in
the ascendancy and the scrubs got their first thorough
licking in more than three weeks. Perhaps
it needed just that to restore the first’s confidence,
for thereafter, while the season lasted, it never
again bowed to its friendly enemy. Russell saw
hard work and took hard blows, but lived very
fully those days and enjoyed life exceedingly. His
comrade on his left, Wells, was wrought to new
heights of eloquence daily, eloquence that, as his
opponents gathered speed, failed more and more
of effect. By the end of that week Wells had
fairly exhausted his powers of sarcasm and vituperation
and had subsided into an amazed silence
that was almost pathetic to observe. He played
on, but it was easily seen that his heart was not
in it. Battle had lost its savor for the right tackle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>Coach Cade chose to devote Friday to smoothing
off the angles in preparation for the Oak
Grove Academy contest the next day, and hence
the second, its season almost over, was released
from work that day. Oak Grove was not ordinarily
a hard proposition; had, in fact, been given
the date for that reason; but, with the Kenly game
a week later, the time had come for a dress rehearsal.
Indeed that time, but for the slump,
would have arrived a week before. Released from
practice, Russell went to the Sign of the Football
at three to relieve Stick. He found the latter busy
and the counter fairly crowded with customers
and friends. Russell had long since discovered
that it took, on the average, two and a half boys
to conduct a purchase; which is to say that a
customer was usually accompanied by from two
to three—sometimes four—companions whose
duty it was to lend advice and counsel. Russell
went to Stick’s aid and half an hour later the last
purchaser had departed and the store was, for
the moment, empty of all save the partners and
the ever-present Mr. J. Warren Pulsifer. Stick,
free to return to school, lingered, and Russell
guessed that he had something on his mind. What
it was developed after a few moments of desultory
conversation.</p>

<p>“Say,” began Stick, “I suppose you don’t want
to buy me out, Rus.”</p>

<p>Russell shook his head slowly. “No, Stick.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
That is, I’d be glad to do it, if you wanted me
to, but I haven’t got enough money. If I took
a hundred and twenty-five out of the business I’d
be in a hole right off. There’s another month’s
rent coming due pretty soon, and three bills that
must be paid by the twentieth. Maybe after the
first of the year, though, I could manage it. Still,
I don’t see why you want to get out, Stick. Things
are coming our way at last and we’re doing pretty
well.”</p>

<p>Stick nodded gloomily. “I know,” he agreed,
“but—but I’ve got another use for the money.”
He avoided Russell’s gaze, however, and the latter
surmised that the statement wasn’t exactly
truthful. The true explanation was indicated by
Stick’s next remark. “You think you’ve got
Crocker beaten, Rus, but he’s going to get you
yet.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe so, Stick, honestly. I’m sorry
you can’t get out if you want to, but I don’t believe
you’ll lose anything by staying in.”</p>

<p>Stick looked unimpressed during the short silence
that followed. At last: “Well, I’ve made up
my mind,” he said a trifle defiantly. “I can’t afford
to lose that money, Rus. Now, I tell you
what I’ll do. I’ll give you until next Wednesday.
Maybe you’ll change your mind. Maybe you can
get the money somewhere?” Stick’s voice ended
in a rising inflection.</p>

<p>Russell shook his head. “I can’t, Stick. But I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
don’t understand, I guess. Suppose I don’t
change my mind by Wednesday. What do you intend
to do?”</p>

<p>Stick hesitated. Then, “Sell out,” he answered
challengingly.</p>

<p>Russell stared. “Sell out! But I tell you I
can’t— Oh, I see! You mean to some one else.”
Stick nodded. “I’m afraid you won’t find that
very easy, Stick. Folks wouldn’t consider it a
very enticing investment just now.” Russell
smiled a little at his friend’s surprising ignorance,
and Stick caught the smile and bristled.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” he answered. “Don’t you
worry. I’ve found some one who’ll buy me out to-day
if I’ll sell. I just thought I ought to give you
first chance.” Something in Russell’s expression
caused him to add hastily: “I’ve got a right to sell,
haven’t I?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I suppose you have,” replied Russell
quietly. “At least, I guess the law would say so,
but it seems to me that, in a partnership like this,
selling out to a third person isn’t just fair, Stick.”</p>

<p>“Why isn’t it? I’ve offered to sell to you—”</p>

<p>“You know I can’t buy!”</p>

<p>“That’s not my fault! This thing isn’t going
to make money: it’s going on the rocks just as soon
as Crocker starts in to really fight you! I want
to get out while there’s time, and I mean to. If
you can’t buy my interest I’ve got a perfect right
to sell it to some one else, and I’m going to.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>“Who is it, Stick?” asked Russell.</p>

<p>“Fellow named Throgmorton.”</p>

<p>“One of our fellows?”</p>

<p>“Sure.” Stick nodded vigorously. “He came
to see me yesterday, and again to-day. He’s going
to give me a hundred and fifty for my share
in the business. I’ll sell to you for a hundred and
twenty-five, just what I put in. That’s fair
enough, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Russell had to acknowledge that it was. “But
why does Throgmorton want to buy you out?” he
asked perplexedly.</p>

<p>Stick shrugged. Evidently that didn’t interest
him. “He says the thing’s all right. I let him
think so.”</p>

<p>“But how did he learn that you wanted to
sell?”</p>

<p>“I guess he heard it somewhere,” answered the
other evasively. “Maybe he didn’t know it. He
didn’t say so. He just came to me and asked.”</p>

<p>Russell frowned. “Throgmorton,” he mused.
“I don’t believe I know him. Did he say he knew
me, Stick?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t believe so. He’s all right, though.
He’s a senior, Rus; a big, dark-looking fellow.
You’ll know him when you see him. I guess he
would make a good partner. He talks like he knew
a good deal about business.”</p>

<p>“He understands, I suppose, that he isn’t buying
an equal interest?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, sure! He said you and he would get on
all right. Said he had this money and wanted to
make a little more, and thought this was a good
way.” Stick laughed. “I let him keep right on
thinking so.”</p>

<p>Russell shook his head. “I don’t understand
it,” he murmured. “Fellows don’t usually have
a hundred and fifty dollars lying around loose like
that.”</p>

<p>“I don’t say he’s got it in his pocket,” replied
Stick. “Maybe it’s in the bank. But I guess he
can get hold of it all right. He talks straight, anyway.”</p>

<p>“Well, I wish you wouldn’t do this,” said
Russell pleadingly. “Honest, Stick, we’ll make
this go if you’ll hold on. Why, we’ve got a lot of
business in sight right now. We’ve got the hockey
and basket ball teams, and I wouldn’t be surprised
if we got the baseball team too. And then there’s
that stuff for Mr. Kincaid. That’s almost certain.
And next fall—”</p>

<p>But Stick was shaking his head stubbornly.
“That’s all right, Rus. You believe all that,
maybe, but I don’t. I’ve made up my mind. I’d
rather sell out to you, even if I didn’t make anything,
but if you can’t buy, why, I’m going to sell
to Throgmorton. You’ve got until next Wednesday,
anyway. I promised him I’d give him his
answer then.”</p>

<p>“You can give him his answer to-morrow just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
as well,” said Russell sadly. “Waiting until
Wednesday doesn’t help me any.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’d rather,” replied Stick. “I’d feel
better about it. You—you think it over, Rus.
Well, I’ll be getting back. I told Wallace I’d play
him some tennis at four. So long!”</p>

<p>Russell didn’t have much time to reflect on this
new and sudden turn of affairs until closing time,
for as Stick went his way two high school fellows
entered in search of gymnasium togs, and after
that the store was never quite empty of customers.</p>

<p>Between him and Stick the matter was not
again mentioned that evening, but after supper
Russell made his way across to Lykes and found
Jimmy and Stanley in Number 4. It wasn’t until
Stanley took himself out after a while that Russell
confided his perplexities, however. Jimmy took
a philosophical view of the situation, although he
did refer disparagingly to Stick as a “quitter.”</p>

<p>“I don’t know this Throgmorton chap,” he said,
“but I’ve seen him about and he looks all right.
I think Stan has met him. I believe he’s rather
a shark for study and copped a scholarship last
year. After all, he can’t trouble you much, can
he? I mean, you’ve got the say about things.”</p>

<p>“Y-yes, of course,” Russell agreed hesitatingly.</p>

<p>“Besides,” went on the other cheeringly, “it
ought to be a grand relief to get rid of that crêpe-hanger.
Patterson has a conniption fit every time
you suggest buying another dollar’s worth of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
stock or paying a quarter to have the window
cleaned. He can think up more reasons for not
spending a dime than any fellow I ever saw! If
this Throgmorton chap is willing to invest a hundred
and fifty in the business he’s likely to want
to see it succeed. Besides, he’s a senior and will
have more time to put in at the store than Patterson
has.”</p>

<p>“Stick’s a senior, too,” reminded Russell.</p>

<p>“I know, but he’s a regular crab when it comes
to doing his share. Honest, Rus, I wouldn’t be
surprised if this turned out to be a stroke of luck.”</p>

<p>“Well, maybe,” agreed Russell doubtfully.
“I guess what worried me most was having some
one I don’t know for a partner.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you go and see him and have a
talk?” asked Jimmy. “It wouldn’t take long to
find out what he’s like.”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe I will,” answered the other
slowly. “If I didn’t like him I couldn’t do anything
about it. Stick’s set on going through with
it. Gee, I wish I could buy him out myself!”</p>

<p>“Too bad you can’t,” said Jimmy sympathetically.
“I suppose when Throgmorton takes hold
I’ll get fired.”</p>

<p>“Not unless you want to be,” said Russell, smiling.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess there’s not much chance of promotion
and I’d better give notice and look about
for something else,” replied Jimmy, grinning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
“I’ll help out awhile longer, though. I’ve really
had rather a good time, Rus. I’m sort of sorry
dad’s so—that is, I’d kind of like to keep a store
of some sort. It’s fun, Rus.”</p>

<p>“You might buy Mr. J. Warren Pulsifer out,”
suggested Russell with a smile. “I guess he’d be
glad to sell to you!”</p>

<p>“Fine idea! Only, you see, he can’t sell.”</p>

<p>“Can’t sell? Why not?”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s quite a story, Rus. He confided it
to me one morning almost with tears in his eyes.
You see—”</p>

<p>“You mean to tell me that Mr. Pulsifer <em>talked</em>
to you?”</p>

<p>“Of course! Why not? Oh, I see what you
mean. Yes, he is inclined to be a bit taciturn, but
he will talk if you prod him. We didn’t mix much
at first, but I treated him kindly and now we’re
quite thick. Funny old guy, but human underneath.
You see, Rus, he’s a man with a secret
sorrow.”</p>

<p>“What’s his sorrow?”</p>

<p>“Here’s the yarn. It seems that he had an
aunt who ran a sort of a florist’s establishment in
connection with her home. She was fond of
flowers and started in selling them to the neighbors.
Then other folks came—there wasn’t any
other florist around then—and so she built a
greenhouse and, first thing she knew, had quite
a trade. That was quite a while back, though, before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
the town was as big as it is. Of course she
had competition finally and her business sort of
petered out. But she didn’t give up. Instead,
she died. And when she died she left the place,
quite a big piece of ground with a nice house on
it, to J. Warren on condition that he continue the
business.</p>

<p>“Well, J. Warren, according to what he didn’t
say, was on his uppers about then. He had married
and the old sock was full of nothing much but
holes. He had some sort of a job with the railway,
he said. So he moved to the auntcestral
home—rather good, what?—and turned himself
into a florist. But folks didn’t come that far any
more, for there were other florists in town here,
and pretty soon the business was on its last legs.
J. Warren was willing enough to let it die, for, as
he said, he hated messing around with flowers and
didn’t know a—a sunflower from a violet when
he started. But he had a feeling that he wasn’t
carrying out the terms of the will, as the lawyer
chaps say, without making another struggle. So
he opened up this place, stopped raising flowers
and bought them instead. By that time he had
sold off three or four pieces of the land for house-lots
and, I fancy, had plenty of money. This place
has never paid. He’s lost money every year.
He’d like nothing better than quit, but he’s got
an enlarged conscience, you see, and there’s the
will and dear old Auntie’s dying command! What<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
he really wants to do is go home and shut himself
up in a third-floor room and work on an invention
of his; something to do with train signals, as near
as I could make out.”</p>

<p>“Still, I don’t see why he can’t sell the business.”</p>

<p>“Conscience, dear boy. Auntie wanted him to
continue the business. She didn’t say for how
long, and there’s the joker. J. Warren dopes it
out that just as long as there’s any business to
continue it’s up to him to continue it. And he
plays fair, too. He advertises and tries to keep
the thing going. But he’s set himself a limit.
When the losses reach a certain figure—he didn’t
tell me what—he will consider that he’s done his
duty and close up shop. I thought at first, when
I saw him figuring and figuring there at that little
desk of his, that he was worried about business
and was trying to make out whether he could
make ends meet. But he wasn’t, Rus. He was
figuring how much longer he’d have to keep things
going. Haven’t you ever noticed how he always
frowns and looks dejected if some one comes and
wants to buy anything? Sure! Every purchase
sets him back just so much. Every time there’s
a funeral he figures that the time when he can
shut himself up in that third-floor room is delayed
another two or three days. You ought to
hear him talk about the doctors in this town! He
says they’re a lot of ‘nincompoops’—whatever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
that is—and that the mortality here is disgraceful.
And he’s as keen as anything for the bill in
the legislature that makes Armistice Day a state
holiday. J. Warren believes in holidays, lots of
’em. The more holidays the less business, and
the less business the sooner the florist establishment
of J. Warren Pulsifer gets its death blow
and J. Warren grabs a screw-driver and a cold
chisel and goes back to inventing!”</p>

<p>“Now,” said Russell, laughing, “I know why
he was so funny about renting that half of the
store to us. One moment he’d be all scowls and
the next quite willing!”</p>

<p>“Of course! Auntie pulling one way and the
third-floor room another! Well, you see why it
isn’t possible for me to buy him out and become a
florist.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad he isn’t bothered about
money,” said Russell. “I was afraid he was
getting ready to jump in the river! He didn’t
say how much longer he expected the business to
last, did he?”</p>

<p>“N-no, but I rather gathered that, if all goes
well—I should say badly—he will be free of it
in about one more year.”</p>

<p>“Good,” laughed Russell. “Of course, I’m
sorry that his business is doing so well, but I’d
hate to have to look for new quarters this year.
Maybe by next we’ll be ready to rent the whole
building.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s so. You ought to. Say, Rus, I
wouldn’t be surprised if you could supply the
football team next fall. I was telling Tod Tenney
about you and the shop the other day. Tod will
be manager next year, you know. He was mighty
interested and said he didn’t see why they couldn’t
buy their stuff here as well as in New York. Of
course, he didn’t make any promises, and, I suppose,
he would have to consult others about it,
but it looks promising.”</p>

<p>“That was mighty kind of you,” said Russell
gratefully. “You’ve been awfully decent to me,
Jimmy, lots of ways, and I want you to know—”</p>

<p>“Can it,” said Jimmy.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX">CHAPTER XX</a><br />
<small>JIMMY HAS A CLEW</small></h2>
</div>


<p>It was a rejuvenated team that met Oak Grove
Academy the following afternoon. I don’t mean
that it played faultless football, for it didn’t, but
it had certainly come back wonderfully, and the
School, looking on, marveled and perked up and,
toward the end of the game, regained its old confidence
and belief. It might have been argued that
Oak Grove was, after all, not a very strong
opponent, but that argument would have been
wasted. Besides, while Oak Grove doubtless did
show herself weak in one or two departments, it
was still true that she had passed through a successful
season, sustaining but one defeat, and that
two weeks before she had held Kenly to a 6 to 9
score.</p>

<p>It was the first full-period game of the season,
and the sixty minutes of actual playing time was
filled with excitement and, from an Alton point
of view at least, pleasure. From the third or
fourth minute of the contest, when Oak Grove
fumbled on her forty yards and watched Putney
gobble up the ball and streak down the field for
a touchdown, to the last twilighted moments when,
her back to her goal, Alton, her line holding many<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
substitutes, repelled the frenzied attacks of the
enemy and finally punted out of danger, the
interest never flagged. Jimmy stood eight yards
behind the goal-line when he sent the ball corkscrewing
away into the gathering gloom, and even
as it fell into the anxious hands of the enemy
quarter-back the last whistle sounded. The score
at the end was 21 to 6.</p>

<p>Ned Richards gained new fame that day, not
by spectacular dashes, but by the truly remarkable
manner in which he ran the team. There were
weak places in the line, there were faults of performance
all through, but the generalship was of
the best. Ned was steady in his catching of punts,
too, and once or twice gained ground for his side,
but it was as a commander of men and a strategist
that Ned excelled. There were other heroes beside
Ned, though none were really outstanding. Perhaps
when all is said and done Jimmy deserved as
much credit as any other player in the last two
periods. He entered the game when the third
quarter was a few minutes old and when, with the
game secure by an 18 to 3 score, it was thought
best to kick rather than rush. Jimmy surprised
his audience, perhaps even Jimmy, by the length
of his punts and the direction of them. Nothing
hurried him or seemed to fluster him. Time and
again the ball escaped the upthrust hands of the
charging enemy by an apparent miracle. But escape
it always did. Jimmy had no kicks blocked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>Harmon, at left half, Browne, at full-back,
Nichols, at center, and Rowlandson, at left guard,
played top-notch football. Captain Proctor was,
as always, good, although to-day he was far from
at his best. The Alton ends were not up to the
rest of the forwards, and the right of the line,
especially after Raleigh had replaced Stimson at
guard, was decidedly weak. Tackling was not of
the best, the team was penalized far too often and
there were times when even Ned’s most frantic
efforts failed to speed up the players. But the
old fight was back again, the old will to win, and
that brought victory. And victory brought joy
to the School.</p>

<p>Even in the sudden turn from pessimism to
cheerfulness, Alton did not, however, swing to the
extreme. No one, perhaps, yet looked for a conclusive
victory over Kenly Hall next week. Many
predicted a tie, some a triumph by a few points—perhaps
a goal after touchdown or even a goal
from the field. But the main thing was that the
Gray-and-Gold had shown that afternoon that,
come what might, she was not to be trampled on;
that, victor or vanquished, she would uphold the
honor of Alton and its proud traditions. So the
student body took hope, and high spirits reigned.
If Alton was not destined to win, at best the
enemy’s triumph was to be insignificant. That the
School should find reason for rejoicing on so slight
an excuse was, when one considered it, strange,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
for a preponderance of victories during recent
years had endowed Alton with a perhaps excusable
arrogance. A more disinterested philosopher than
any of our characters might have told himself that
a defeat for the Gray-and-Gold would possibly
prove an unpalatable but beneficial medicine!</p>

<p>Naturally enough a certain restraint existed
between the roommates in Number 27 Upton subsequent
to Stick Patterson’s ultimatum. In spite
of being quite convinced that he was acting within
his rights, Stick was uncomfortable and showed it
by acting in an unusually care-free and careless
manner which fooled neither him nor Russell. On
his part, Russell, recognizing his friend’s privilege
of selling his interest as he had indicated,
tried to feel no sense of injury, failed and was unnaturally
polite and awkward in Stick’s presence.
It was a relief to both when either could avail
himself of an excuse to get away. Fortunately
for Russell football affairs took precedence over
all else during the next few days. The Best
Second Team in the History of Alton Academy
was finishing its career at full steam, and Russell
was steaming with it. Monday and Tuesday saw
battles royal between the first and the scrub.
Wednesday’s meeting was less ferocious, since
then the second was used as a battering ram and,
given the ball time and again on the first team’s
ten yards, was instructed to carry it over. That
success came but once, and then with the aid of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
a half-distance penalty, spoke well for the big
team’s reviving defense. Work was interrupted
frequently while coaches explained and corrected,
and under such circumstances the old fury of
battle was sadly wanting. Thursday, though, contrary
to established custom, saw one final, glorious
struggle. The second, knowing that it was the
last, offered life and limb and fought as never before.
More than once Coach Cade was forced to
intervene and caution in the interest of his charges
and Coach Gaston was obliged, unwillingly it
appeared, to echo the remonstrance. That was
a fine and fitting finish for the second, for although
the first scored a touchdown and kicked
a field-goal, the scrub team took the ball away
from the enemy on the latter’s forty-two yards
and, growling and snarling, plunged and twisted,
battered and hammered her way across nine almost
obliterated white lines and set the pigskin
behind the first team’s goal. That march was
epic. Friendship was forgotten and no mercy was
asked nor shown. Behind the retreating, amazed
first team line Coach Cade barked passionate entreaties.
In the wake of the second Steve Gaston,
an unholy light of triumph on his lean face, roared
hoarsely.</p>

<p>“Fight! <em>Fight!</em> FIGHT!” urged Steve. “Six
yards more! You can do it, Second! Take it over!
It’s your last chance! Don’t quit now! Smash
them! Smear them! Fight, Second.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>To the cries of the coaches were added the panting
expostulations, appeals, commands of the
quarterbacks and captains and the hoarse clamors
of the players. Wells, of the second, had found
his old eloquence once more and his voice sounded
well above the bedlam. “Yah! Try that again,
you mutton-face! Come on, Second! Tear ’em
up! Look out, you yellow curs, we’re coming
through! Yah!”</p>

<p>And then red-headed Reilly was flat on the yellowing
sod, his legs in their torn gray hose inside
the field but his body in its sweat-stained jacket
well over and the pigskin nestled beneath him in
a grip that would have resisted wild horses! No
goal was kicked, none attempted. The last scrimmage
was over. Friend and foe faced each other,
panting, glaring, growling. A hushed moment
passed. Then tense faces relaxed. The second
swarmed together and beat each other’s backs and
turned somersaults with the last ounce of remaining
strength, shouted with what breath was left in
their well-nigh empty lungs, and the first looked
on with understanding at least. A few grins
made their appearance, gruesome efforts, maybe,
on dirt-marked and sometimes battered countenances.
Then Captain Proctor, leaning heavily on
Rowlandson’s big shoulder, lifted a tired voice.</p>

<p>“Regular ... cheer ... for the ... Second
... fellows!... All together! Come on!”</p>

<p>And the second, grouping themselves about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
Captain Falls, came back heartily, and their season
was over, the duties finished, their rest at
hand!</p>

<p>But that was on Thursday, and before it happened
other events had occurred which must be
set down here. It was Tuesday night that Jimmy
appeared hurriedly at Number 27 and, since Stick
was seated across the table from Russell, decoyed
the latter into the corridor and thence downstairs
to a corner of the recreation room.</p>

<p>“Look here,” he began when they were seated,
“there may not be anything in this, but I thought
I’d better tell you. You know that fellow Throgmorton?
Well, I’ve just discovered that he and
Billy Crocker are as thick as thieves. I happened
to see them together in the village this morning.
They went into the drug store across the street.
Had drinks, I suppose. Then I asked Stimson
this evening at table; he rooms in the same
corridor with Throgmorton; and Stimson says
those two are great pals. Crocker’s at Throgmorton’s
room half the time.”</p>

<p>Russell stared blankly. “You mean—”</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think? Here’s this old
geezer, Crocker, trying to put you out of business.
Patterson gets an offer for his interest from
Throgmorton. Throgmorton is young Crocker’s
pal. Smell a rat?”</p>

<p>Russell nodded. “Still,” he said, “I don’t see—why,
even if Throgmorton bought Stick out—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>“Why, he’d sell to old Crocker again the next
minute! Throgmorton doesn’t want to buy in
for himself. I don’t believe he’s got any hundred
and fifty to his name. Billy Crocker has probably
arranged the whole transaction. He picked on
Throgmorton because Throgmorton wouldn’t
arouse suspicion and you wouldn’t dream that old
man Crocker was behind him. But Billy made the
silly mistake of letting me see them together; and
that got me thinking.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’re right,” agreed Russell dejectedly.
“Although even if Mr. Crocker owns a
minority interest he can’t do much damage, can
he? I’ve still got the say about things. I don’t
mean that it would be very pleasant—”</p>

<p>“Wake up, son! How long do you suppose
you’d keep on doing business if old Crocker
wanted to close you up? He’d find plenty of ways
to put the store on the blink. No, sir, it won’t
do, Rus, and you’ve got to find some way of fooling
’em.”</p>

<p>“You’re right, Jimmy. Well, I don’t believe
that Stick will sell to Throgmorton when I tell
him this. He’s a pretty decent sort, after all. He
will be disappointed—”</p>

<p>Jimmy laughed incredulously. “Why, you
silly chump, Stick Patterson does know! At least,
I’m pretty sure he does. I’ll bet he and old
Crocker fixed it up between them.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, I don’t believe that,” Russell expostulated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
“I don’t believe Stick has ever even spoken
with Mr. Crocker.”</p>

<p>Jimmy looked puzzled. “Hasn’t spoken to
him? Why, how about that time when Crocker
was in the store? Saturday before last, wasn’t
it?”</p>

<p>Russell looked blank. “Saturday? You mean
that Mr. Crocker was in our store and talked to
Stick? Are you sure?”</p>

<p>“Of course. J. Warren told me. Said the old
guy was there half an hour or more talking with
Patterson. He couldn’t tell what they were talking
about, but he said it looked like something
important. I thought of course Patterson had
told you.”</p>

<p>Russell shook his head. “He didn’t say a word
about it,” he replied soberly. He was silent a
moment. Then, “I wouldn’t have thought it of
Stick,” he sighed.</p>

<p>“I don’t know that I would,” said Jimmy. “He
doesn’t seem quite such a cut-throat as that. But
it certainly looks—”</p>

<p>“Yes, I guess he fixed it up with Mr. Crocker.
Well, if he did there isn’t anything I can do.
There’s no use asking him not to sell.”</p>

<p>“Of course not. Now I’ve been mulling it over
ever since I talked with Stimson. What you want
to do is buy out Stick yourself.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but I can’t. I don’t dare take enough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
money out of the bank, Jimmy. It would leave
me flat, and—”</p>

<p>“Wait a sec! What about Patterson? Will
he give you until to-morrow noon, say?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I think so. He said I could have until
Wednesday to buy him out. To-morrow’s
Wednesday, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, if it doesn’t rain. Now listen. Here’s
a proposition. I haven’t worked it out yet, but— Look,
Rus! You see Patterson right away and
make him agree not to sell until twelve to-morrow.
By that time you’ll have the money.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have the money,” agreed Russell. “Of
course. Some one’s going to die and leave it to
me, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Shut up! I’ll get it for you. Listen, idiot.”
Jimmy dropped his voice another note, although
the nearest person was a small boy half the length
of the long room away. “I’ll jump the ten-twenty
train to-night. That’ll get me to New York at
twelve-forty. I’ll put up at a hotel and be downtown
at nine in the morning. Dad always gets to
his office at ten past. That’ll give me thirty-six
minutes to see him and get the nine-forty-six
back. That gets here at eleven-thirty-three. I’ll
take a carriage—”</p>

<p>“Are you crazy?” interrupted Russell.</p>

<p>Jimmy chuckled. “Not a bit. It’s a cinch.
You stall Patterson off until twelve—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>“But your father isn’t going to let you have a
hundred and twenty-five dollars for a crazy business
like this!”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, he is. He’s a good sort, dad is. I
can get a check from him and make that express
easy.”</p>

<p>“But, Jimmy, you’re sick in the head! A hundred
and twenty-five dollars is a lot of money.
Even if your father happened to have that much
to spare right now he wouldn’t—”</p>

<p>“Huh?” Jimmy looked surprised. “To spare?
Oh, I see.” He grinned then. “Rus, you don’t
happen to know who my dad is, do you?” Russell
shook his head. “He’s Austen of Austen and
Cooper.”</p>

<p>“Is he?” asked Russell, unimpressed.</p>

<p>“Oh, gee,” laughed Jimmy, “you’re no New
Yorker, are you? Well, Austen and Cooper are
a couple of disgustingly wealthy old men, Rus.
That’s enough for them. Anyway, dad is pretty
sure to be able to dig up a hundred and twenty-five,
and he will let me have it, all right, when I
tell him what it’s for.”</p>

<p>“Oh!” said Russell. “But, look here, Jimmy,
I couldn’t take a loan of that size!”</p>

<p>“Why not? Oh, very well, we won’t argue about
that. I’ll buy Patterson’s interest from you as
soon as you get it from him. That is if you don’t
object to me as a partner. Of course I wouldn’t
be a very active partner after next June, but we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
could make some arrangement that would be fair
to you. The main thing now is—”</p>

<p>“But have you got permission to go to New
York?” interrupted Russell.</p>

<p>Jimmy grinned and shook his head. “Permission?
I couldn’t get it if I tried, you idiot.
And I’ve no notion of trying. No, what I do is
just unostentatiously walk away about half-past
nine. No one’s going to know anything about it.
I’ll have to cut chapel and two classes in the morning,
but I’ve been a pretty good boy so far this
term and that’ll be all right. I’ll be around for
dinner and no one need know I’ve been away.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like it,” protested Russell. “Suppose
Coach Cade got wind of it?”</p>

<p>Jimmy sobered perceptibly and then shrugged.
“Let’s not be Glooms,” he said, grinning. “Of
course there’s a slight risk, but the end excuses
the means, or whatever the saying is. What time
is it now?” He looked at his watch.</p>

<p>“Never you mind what time it is,” said Russell
firmly. “You’re not going to do it, Jimmy. It’s
corking of you to want to, and all that, and I’m
awfully much obliged to you, but you’re staying
right here.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!”</p>

<p>“Yes, you are! Look here, Jimmy. If Mr.
Cade ever found out you know what would happen.
You’d be dumped off the team in a minute. No
matter if you were the mainstay of it, the only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
fellow who could win us a victory over Kenly,
you’d go just the same. You know that. You
know Johnny Cade well enough. Isn’t it so?”</p>

<p>“Possibly, but he isn’t going to know.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he is.”</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“I shall tell him.”</p>

<p>They eyed each other straightly for a moment.
Then:</p>

<p>“You mean that?” asked Jimmy.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Jimmy shrugged. “All right. That’s that.
Only thing left to do is telegraph.”</p>

<p>“How about telephoning?”</p>

<p>“No good. I thought of that. This is Tuesday
and dad will be in town. I’ll send a wire to
the office, but I don’t believe the money will get
here in time. I’ll try it, though. I’ll ask him to
telegraph it. Now let’s see.” Jimmy crossed to
a writing table and brought back a sheet of paper.
While he frowned and wrote, erased and rewrote
Russell fell into thought. He didn’t really believe
that Jimmy would get the money, and he sought
in his mind for some other way out of the dilemma.
He had said that there would be nothing
gained by an appeal to Stick, and yet perhaps he
was wrong. At least, he would try the appeal.
In spite of some faults, Stick had heretofore always
acted straight. Russell’s cogitations were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
interrupted by Jimmy, who thrust the written
message in a pocket and got to his feet.</p>

<p>“I’ll cut across to the telegraph office and get
this off,” Jimmy announced. “Come along?”</p>

<p>Russell shook his head. “I guess not. I think
I’ll have a talk with Stick.”</p>

<p>“We-ell, all right. Going to the cheer meeting?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I think so.”</p>

<p>“See you in the morning, anyway. Don’t forget
to get Patterson to hold off until twelve to-morrow;
later, if he’s willing. And keep your
head up, Rus. We’ll pull it off all right.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI">CHAPTER XXI</a><br />
<small>STICK SELLS OUT</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Stick Patterson was drawing meaningless
lines and figures on a sheet of paper when Russell
opened the door, and he didn’t cease doing it nor
relapse from his preoccupied attitude until Russell
had drawn his chair nearer the end of the
table, from where he could see his companion without
having to dodge the lamp, and seated himself.
Then Stick looked across gloomily.</p>

<p>“I want to talk about—about this,” announced
Russell.</p>

<p>Stick returned his level gaze a moment and
then tossed the pencil he had held aside and thrust
his hands into the pockets of his coat. “So do I,”
he replied with a tone of relief. “Look here, Rus,
I’ve been thinking about it, and I guess I’ve been
wrong. I don’t believe it would be fair to you
to sell out to some other chap. You and he might
not get on together the way we do. I’ve decided
to stick it out. Maybe later you’ll have the money.
Anyway, I’ll stay with you to the end of the school
year, or as long as we hold out. Even if we do
bust, maybe we’ll save something.”</p>

<p>“That’s fine, Stick,” replied Russell gratefully.
“And it’s very decent of you. You have a perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
right to sell, of course, but if you did it would
put me out of business, I guess.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see why, Rus. Anyway, I’m not going—”</p>

<p>“Because Mr. Crocker would see to it, Stick.
You don’t really believe that he has any idea of
keeping both businesses going?”</p>

<p>“What’s Crocker got to do with it?” asked
Stick.</p>

<p>“A whole lot if he owned your interest.”</p>

<p>“But he wouldn’t.” Stick looked genuinely
puzzled. “This fellow Throgmorton—”</p>

<p>“Stick,” interrupted Russell, “did Mr. Crocker
stop in at the store a week ago last Saturday?”</p>

<p>“What? Why, yes, he did. I didn’t say anything
about it because—well, he didn’t want me
to, and—Oh, well, I know I ought to have told you,
but he said he thought he might find some one who
would buy my interest, and that you’d better not
know about it until it was settled. It was sort of
low-down, Rus, and I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>“Crocker didn’t offer to buy himself, then?”</p>

<p>“Crocker? No, he said he wouldn’t take it at
any price. Of course I wouldn’t have sold to him,
anyway.”</p>

<p>“Then you really thought that Throgmorton
wanted your interest for himself?”</p>

<p>Stick stared. “Of course! Didn’t he? Look
here, you don’t mean—”</p>

<p>“He and Billy Crocker, Mr. Crocker’s son, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
together a lot,” answered Russell. “And Mr.
Crocker would like to see our place closed up. I
can’t prove it, but—”</p>

<p>“You don’t need to!” cried Stick angrily. “Of
course that was the game! You wait until I see
that smart Aleck! I’ll—I’ll tell him where he
gets off! I’ll kick him across the Green! I’ll—”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t say anything about it,” said Russell
soothingly. “He only has to deny it. You
can’t prove anything, Stick.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right! I don’t need to do any proving!”
Stick, as has been already intimated,
greatly disliked having anything “put over on
him.” “The fat-head! I thought it was funny,
his wanting to buy into the business. Why—”
Stick paused and dropped his voice several tones.
“I say, Rus, I didn’t suspect that for a minute.
I wish you’d believe me. I know it looks funny.
But honest—”</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” replied Russell. “I believe
you, Stick. I couldn’t quite believe that you meant
to do anything like that.”</p>

<p>“But wasn’t I the goop?” muttered Stick incredulously.
“Never thought that that old shifty-eyed
rascal was trying to pull my leg! He was
so thunderingly nice and—and sympathetic! You
wait till I see the old fraud! You wait—”</p>

<p>“Never mind that,” laughed Russell. “After
all, the laugh’s on your side, Stick, for you’ve got
them fooled. When you tell Throgmorton you’ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
changed your mind—hold on, though! How can
you get out of it? You gave him your promise,
didn’t you?”</p>

<p>“I said he could have it if you didn’t take it
by to-morrow,” answered Stick, “but he didn’t
tell me he was buying to sell again to Crocker!
He can chase himself now!”</p>

<p>“Still, a promise is a promise,” mused Russell.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell him you’ve bought it. No, I guess that
wouldn’t do, either.” Stick scowled perplexedly.
“I’ll tell you—”</p>

<p>“It’s barely possible I may be able to get the
money by twelve to-morrow,” Russell cut in. He
told about Jimmy’s plan and Stick listened impatiently
until the end. Then:</p>

<p>“Austen can’t have it,” he declared vehemently.
“No one can have it! I’m going to keep it myself,
and we’re going to show that old pirate of
a Crocker that he can’t run us out of business!
But I will do this, Rus. I’ll take your note now
for a hundred and twenty-five dollars and you
can have my interest until noon to-morrow. Then
we trade back. Here’s a piece of paper.”</p>

<p>“What shall I write?” asked Russell.</p>

<p>“‘One month after date I promise to pay to
George Patterson One Hundred and Twenty-five
Dollars with interest at six per cent.’ Now date
it and sign your name.”</p>

<p>“But is it legal, Stick?”</p>

<p>“I guess so. It’s legal enough for me, anyway.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
I’ve sold out to you and I can tell Throgmorton
so without lying. That’s all I want.”</p>

<p>“I forgot to tell you,” said Russell as Stick
folded the piece of paper and thrust it into the
drawer on his side of the table, “that there’s a
pretty fair chance of our selling to the football
team next fall.” He recounted Jimmy’s talk with
Tod Tenney. “There’s nothing certain,” he
ended, “but I’m going to speak to Mr. Cade some
day before he goes away, and—”</p>

<p>“Of course we’ll get it!” put in Stick almost
impatiently. “We’ll work for it until we do!
Rus, when we get through with old man Crocker
he’ll be selling hardware and nothing else, believe
me!”</p>

<p>“All right,” laughed Russell. “Now do you
want to go over to the football mass meeting?”</p>

<p>The next morning appeared Jimmy with a tragic
countenance. His father’s secretary had wired
him that Mr. Austen was in Boston and would not
be back until to-morrow. “He says,” wailed
Jimmy, “that he will bring the matter to father’s
attention immediately on his return, the crazy
galoot, but what good will that do? It wouldn’t
have hurt him to have used his bean and sent the
money!”</p>

<p>Russell soothed him with news of Stick’s new
attitude, and Jimmy glowed with delight. Then
he chuckled. “I’d like to be there when Patterson
talks to Throgmorton,” he said wistfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span></p>

<p>“Well, there won’t be any bloodshed,” replied
Russell. “Stick usually calms down before the
battle begins! And Throgmorton, you tell me, is
fairly sizable.”</p>

<p>Jimmy grinned. “That’s so. I guess Patterson
is too wise to start anything he can’t finish.
Well, I’m awfully glad it’s turned out so well.
I’m sort of sorry, though, that I’m not to get a
finger in the pie after all. I believe you and I,
Rus, could have made the Sign of the Football
pay real money.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Jimmy, I guess we could have, but it’s
going to pay real money as it is, I think, for
Stick’s as stubborn as a mule, and now that he’s
decided to work instead of growl I believe we’ll
make a success of it.”</p>

<p>“Hope so,” said Jimmy. “You’ve got my best
wishes, old son, if they’ll do you any good. By
the way, I’m glad you kept me from making a
useless trip to New York last night. Wouldn’t I
have been sore when I got to the office this morning
and found dad wasn’t there? Still, I’ll bet
I’d have dug that money out of some one before
I left! Well, so long, Rus. Come over to-night
and tell me what happens.”</p>

<p>Not very much did happen. Stick kept his engagement
with Throgmorton at the latter’s room
and found Billy Crocker with him. The money
was there, too, seven nice new twenties and a ten.
There was, too, a very official looking paper awaiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
Stick’s signature, and Billy Crocker explained
his presence by stating that he was there as a witness.
Stick took the money and counted it slowly,
prolonging the agony, as he put it later to Russell.
Then he laid it down and shook his head.</p>

<p>“Anything wrong with it?” demanded Billy.</p>

<p>“No, it looks all right,” replied Stick. “May be
counterfeit, but I can’t tell.”</p>

<p>“Not likely,” said Throgmorton, who was a
large and rather heavy-mannered youth of nineteen.
“Put it in your pocket, Patterson, and sign
on the dotted line.”</p>

<p>Stick shook his head and smiled gently. “No,
I just dropped around to tell you that the deal
is off.”</p>

<p>“Off!” shouted Billy Crocker. “What do you
mean, off?”</p>

<p>“Why, just off; not on,” explained Stick
patiently. “O, double-F, off. Meaning nothing
doing, Crocker.”</p>

<p>“Why?” asked Throgmorton darkly.</p>

<p>“Emerson bought,” replied Stick.</p>

<p>“That’s a lie,” cried Billy. “See here, you
agreed to sell to us—”</p>

<p>“‘Us’?” Stick’s brows went up.</p>

<p>“To Throg, here,” corrected Billy. “Now
you’re welching, and—”</p>

<p>“But, my dear fellow,” protested Stick,
thoroughly enjoying the other’s disappointment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
“how can I sell what I haven’t got? Be reasonable.”</p>

<p>“Oh, shut up!” wailed Billy. “You make me
sick!”</p>

<p>“Sorry. Don’t see what business it is of yours,
though. If you must witness something, Crocker,
I’ll sign my name on my cuff for you. Well, I
must be getting on. By the way, you might try
Emerson. Maybe he’ll sell to you. Seems to me
he ought to be glad to get into partnership with
a fine, straightforward man like your father!”</p>

<p>Stick left them staring at him, looking, as he
said to Russell, like two sick cat-fish! And that
ended that affair for the time and Russell heaved
a big sigh of relief. Fortunately he didn’t know
then that Billy Crocker was quite as averse as
was Stick Patterson to having anything put over
on him, and that, unlike Stick, he didn’t forgive
readily.</p>

<p>Thursday saw the end of the season for the
second team, as has been told, and Thursday
night witnessed the second team’s annual banquet
in Ford’s Restaurant, in the town. Twenty-two
battle-scarred but very contented youths ate their
fill and sang and cheered and listened to speeches,
of which that delivered by Coach Steve Gaston,
while the briefest was the best. Steve told them
a lot of nice things about their playing and their
devotion to the School, and he told them, and with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
convincing emphasis, that what he had planned
and hoped for had come true, that he was standing
at that moment in the presence of the finest second
team in the annals of Alton football! At which
the roof of the building must have raised an inch
before the cheering ceased!</p>

<p>They sang their last song at a quarter past ten
and tumbled noisily and hilariously down the
stairs to the street and out into the frosty sharpness
of a starlit night and swung unhurriedly
back to the Academy, very happy and very proud
and, now that the excitement was over, deliciously
tired. Near the end of the walk Russell found
himself beside Steve Gaston. Steve had taken his
season’s task seriously and, in a way, he had taken
the celebration seriously. But now he had relapsed
into a smiling and rather silent content,
and it was not until they were crossing the Green
that he made any lengthy remark. Then:</p>

<p>“Emerson, you certainly worked hard for me—well,
for us, for the School. It’s hard to be impersonal
always. And, for my part, I thank you.
I needed you like the very dickens when I dug you
out that time, and by making good the way you
did you just about saved me. You’ve got another
year, haven’t you? I thought so. Well, let me
tell you something. You may know it already, but
I don’t believe you do. Next fall you walk out
on the field and tell the coach that you’re going to
play right end. You’ll get it!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>Russell pondered that on his way upstairs. Of
course Steve Gaston ought to know, but it did
seem to him that the coach had let his judgment
slip for once! Further cogitation on the subject
was denied him just then, for as soon as he had
stepped into Number 27 he knew that something
startling had happened. Stick’s face was enough.
Stick had thrown the door open at the sound of
Russell’s steps in the corridor and now he was
asking excitedly:</p>

<p>“Have you heard about it, Rus?”</p>

<p>“No! What?”</p>

<p>“Some one broke into the store to-night and
beat up Mr. Pulsifer! They got him, too. That
is, one of him; there were two. I’ve just come
back from there. The police won’t tell who the
fellow is, but every one says it’s Billy Crocker!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII</a><br />
<small>MR. PULSIFER SHAKES HIS HEAD</small></h2>
</div>


<p>It was well along toward the middle of the following
morning before Russell had learned definitely
what had happened at Number 112 West
street. Stick’s account had been exciting but
vague. He had, however, assured Russell that he
had personally made an examination of the premises
and found everything all right, after learning
which Russell had been able to compose himself to
slumber with the determination to await philosophically
the full explanation of the surprising
event. Not that he had sought sleep very early,
for Stick, in spite of small knowledge, had had
much to say, and his theories had prolonged conversation
well toward midnight. In fact, Stick
was still theorizing when Russell dropped asleep.</p>

<p>When he did learn the particulars it was from
the still agitated lips of Mr. J. Warren Pulsifer.
The two met in the police station, whither they
had been summoned, and on a bench in the outer
room waited to be conducted into the presence of
the Chief. Shorn of unnecessary details and repetitions,
the facts were these. Mr. Pulsifer had
gone to the store after supper last evening and
had remained there until nearly ten o’clock. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
had then put out the light, locked the door behind
him and reached the corner of Linden street,
where the post office is situated. There he annoyingly
discovered that he had failed to bring away
with him two letters which he had early in the
evening prepared for the mail. As it was necessary
that they should be delivered in the city early
in the morning, he had thereupon retraced his
steps, entered the store and, without troubling to
light up, groped his way to his desk and found
the letters. He had again started toward the front
of the store when sounds at the rear had attracted
his suspicion. The sounds resembled the straining
of a window sash, as though some one was forcing
it upward with a jimmy.</p>

<p>Mr. Pulsifer had promptly made his way silently
to the window at the left of the rear door.
Sounds outside told him that burglars were at
work. What his emotions were at the moment
Mr. Pulsifer didn’t state. It is to his credit,
though, that he quickly seized the nearest available
weapon, which happened to be a broom reposing
in a corner, and prepared to repel the marauders.
He had barely got into position when
the window sash went up and he dimly saw some
one swing across the sill. What happened then
was still doubtful so far as Mr. Pulsifer’s memory
was concerned. He recalled raising a loud shout
of “<em>Police!</em>” and of swinging the broom lustily.
He recalled, less distinctly, the crash that resulted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
when the broom, evidently missing the intruder,
struck the window glass. Then a surprising number
of stars shot into his vision and when he next
took cognizance of events he was being supported
by a policeman, the store was dazzlingly illuminated
and a second policeman stood by with a firm
grasp on the prisoner.</p>

<p>Mr. Pulsifer had a dreadful headache and a
swelling under his right eye, but after being given
a drink of water was able to recount what had
happened. Fortunately, one of the officers had
been crossing the mouth of the alley on State
street when the sound of breaking glass had
reached him. He had run toward the scene in
time to see a figure speeding away in the opposite
direction, had shouted to it to stop and was
raising his revolver to fire when a second figure
had collided with him at the gate of the rear premises.
The officer had been obliged to use the butt
of his revolver to make his capture, for the prisoner
had strongly objected to being detained. Mr.
Pulsifer, having been assisted from the floor, observed
that the prisoner, who was hardly more
than a boy, although a very robust boy, looked
extremely pale and that he was holding a handkerchief
to the side of his head. Mr. Pulsifer was
uncharitable enough to hope that the prisoner’s
head was aching was much as his was!</p>

<p>After that they had proceeded in a compact
body to the station house, accompanied by an ever-growing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
body of curious spectators. Inside, the
prisoner had, after several hesitations, given his
name as William Crocker and his residence as 43
Munroe avenue. Mr. Pulsifer had duly made a
charge against the prisoner and then been conveyed
in a taxicab to his home.</p>

<p>After some minutes of waiting Russell and his
companion were summoned into the Chief’s office.
The latter did most of the talking. He had, he
informed them, got a confession from the boy.
What had appeared last evening as an attempt at
burglary turned out to be no more than a very
silly school-boy prank. Of course, the Chief
wasn’t excusing young Crocker, but, on the other
hand, Mr. Pulsifer of course knew what boys
were! The offender was a boy of excellent character,
the son of one of Alton’s prominent merchants
and respected citizens and of a hitherto
stainless record. Young Crocker had earnestly
disclaimed having intended any theft or damage,
and the Chief believed him. Now, then, did Mr.
Pulsifer think that any good would be done by
prosecuting the charge already made?</p>

<p>Mr. Pulsifer felt of his cheek, blinked a few
times and shook his head. The Chief smiled his
approbation. Of course, he continued, if Mr. Pulsifer
felt that he had a claim for personal injury
doubtless that matter could be arranged easily
and without publicity. The Chief bore heavily on
the last word. Mr. Pulsifer started to feel of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
cheek, thought better of it and again shook his
head. The Chief looked relieved and arose from
his arm-chair, intimating that the consultation was
at an end and implying that Mr. Pulsifer had
acted in exactly the way he—the Chief—had expected
a gentleman of his wisdom and kindliness
to act. It was Russell, who so far had said nothing,
who, in a way of speaking, spoiled the finale.</p>

<p>“I’d like to ask,” said Russell, “what Crocker
intended to do when he got inside the store.”</p>

<p>The Chief turned a displeased look on him.
“Nothing at all, I understand, nothing at all.
They—that is, he had no plan. It was merely a
foolish prank, conceived hurriedly and carried out
without—er—without reflection.”</p>

<p>“There were two of them in it, I think?” asked
Russell.</p>

<p>“Two of them? Possibly, possibly.” The
Chief frowned darkly. “Only one was apprehended,
Mr. Emerson. As he refuses to state
whether he had an accomp—a companion, that is,
we are left in doubt. And since Mr. Pulsifer has
decided not to prosecute the matter is of no importance.
You are not, I think,” added the
speaker suggestively, “the lessee of the premises?”</p>

<p>“No, but I sub-rent half the store, and—”</p>

<p>“Nothing has been stolen or damaged?”</p>

<p>“Not so far as I know,” acknowledged Russell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<p>“Of course not! Very well then!” The Chief
was once more affable and was herding them
toward the door. “Thank you for your visit,
Mr. Pulsifer. The matter will be allowed to drop,
and so, of course, I trust that neither you nor
Mr. Emerson will discuss it with others. I have
the boy’s promise, and his father’s, that nothing
of the kind will happen again. Good morning!”</p>

<p>Saying good-by to the florist, Russell hurried
back to school and an eleven o’clock recitation.
At twelve he mounted to Number 27 and found
Stick anxiously awaiting his account of the interview.
Russell told what had happened, and Stick
snorted. “Ha, that’s old man Crocker,” he said.
“I suppose he’s got enough influence to get Billy
off if he committed murder! J. Warren’s a spineless
shrimp, if you ask me. Didn’t intend any
mischief! Oh, no, not a bit! If J. Warren hadn’t
been there those two would have put the place
on the blink, I’ll bet! Maybe they wouldn’t have
swiped anything: I don’t believe they meant to:
but they’d have ruined a lot of our stock.”</p>

<p>“Do you think the other fellow was Throgmorton,
Stick?”</p>

<p>“Sure! Why not? Billy was mad because he
couldn’t get my share in the business and he made
up his mind to get square. Throgmorton’s a
chunk of cheese, if you ask me, and Billy probably
made him think it was just a sort of lark. Well,
Crocker got a crack on the head and a couple of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
hours in jail, and he ought to be satisfied!”
Stick’s expression became more mollified. “I
guess we might as well be satisfied, too, Rus. The
laugh’s on our side, all right. Billy’s in bad with
faculty, you see, and out of football— Gee, that
reminds me!”</p>

<p>Stick stepped to the table and rummaged
amongst the litter.</p>

<p>“Out of football!” exclaimed Russell. “Gee,
that’s tough, Stick!”</p>

<p>“Tough?” Stick laughed unfeelingly. “I
don’t see it. Where the dickens is that— Oh,
here it is! That crazy guy Johnson left this a
few minutes ago.”</p>

<p>Russell took the folded sheet of paper and read
the hastily scrawled words amazedly.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Emerson: Report at training table at twelve-thirty.

<small>A MEMBER OF THE TEAM</small></h2>
</div>


<p>Afterwards Russell believed that he didn’t get
his breath again until, at ten o’clock that night,
he put the light out and crawled into his bed.
Things had happened swiftly after the reading of
that note from the first team manager. There had
been dinner at the training table in the corner of
the dining hall, a dinner of which Russell ate little.
His appearance had evoked only few greetings
and had been accepted in a surprisingly matter-of-fact
fashion. Coach Cade was absent from table
and it had been Johnson who had indicated his
chair and briefly explained matters, talking across
Rowlandson in an aside that probably reached the
entire table.</p>

<p>“Crocker’s out of the game to-morrow, Emerson,”
said Johnson, “and we’re shy an end.
Wouldn’t be surprised if you had a shot at the
enemy before the game’s over.”</p>

<p>“I’d be surprised if he didn’t,” growled Rowlandson,
entering without apology into the conversation.
“Seen you play, Emerson. You’re good.
Pass the beets, some one.”</p>

<p>“Well, anyway, you be out at two-thirty this
afternoon,” went on the manager.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a class at two,” said Russell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s all right. They’ve allowed cuts to-day.”</p>

<p>Jimmy came over from the other table where
the substitutes sat while Russell was still toying
with a large helping of tapioca pudding and sank
into the chair at Russell’s left, recently vacated
by Longstreth. “Hail, hail, the gang’s all here!”
whispered Jimmy joyously. “Welcome to the
Brotherhood of Hard Boiled Eggs, Rus! Say,
accept it from yours truly, this is great! When
did they nab you? What happened to Crocker?
I heard he was out on bail and the old man had
shipped him to South America.”</p>

<p>The afternoon was a hectic nightmare for Russell.
He went through a slow but grueling signal
practice with the third squad, conducted about the
second team gridiron by Neirsinger, made innumerable
mistakes, was scolded bitterly by all
hands—who couldn’t, it seemed, make allowance
for one who, only a few hours ago, had been a
complete stranger to first team methods—and
passed a very miserable, blundering forty minutes.
Followed some throwing and catching with
seven other youths, and here Russell regained a
measure of his self-respect. Coach Cade had a
good word for him as he came back to the bench,
and Russell held up his head again. At a quarter
to four they went back to the gymnasium and
took possession of the floor, driving out a few
thin-limbed young gentlemen who had been performing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
aerial feats on the rings. The doors were
locked, benches were dragged noisily from the
walls, the big blackboard was pushed out under
the light and Mr. Cade, chalk in one hand and
pointer in another, began to talk. Russell was
pulled onto a bench between Jimmy and Harley
McLeod. They seemed anxious to make him feel
at home, and he was grateful. The chalk made
dots and rings and figures and lines on the board
and Mr. Cade’s voice went on and on. Russell
tried to understand, but he found his mind and
gaze wandering. Before him, his broad shoulders
rounded as he sat hands between legs, was
Paul Nichols, the center. Beside him on the right
was Ned Richards, two-thirds his size, his scarred
hands clasped behind his tousled head. Harmon,
Alton’s best half-back in several years, came next.
And then Putney and Stimson and Butler. Captain
Proctor was at Russell’s left, further along
the roughly curving row, with Browne, whose big,
long legs stretched far under the bench before
him. Russell couldn’t believe yet that he was
really there, that he was one of this silent congregation
of the school’s elect. A member of the
Alton Football Team! Maybe he would wake up
presently and find that he was dreaming!</p>

<p>He did wake up, but not with that result. Mr.
Cade, noting his wandering glance, had shot a
question at him. “Emerson, what’s the count on
this play?” demanded the coach sharply.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>Russell, startled, shook his head miserably. “I—I
don’t know, sir,” he said.</p>

<p>“And you never will if you don’t listen! Kindly
give me your attention now.”</p>

<p>After that Russell managed to concentrate his
gaze and his mind and began to understand. Presently
they were up, eleven of them, walking slowly
through a play. Twice this was done. Then: “All
right,” said the coach. “Now speed it!” A confused
mingling of bodies and a rush half-way down
the long floor followed. Then eleven more players
went through the same antics, and, finally, eleven
more. Then back to the benches, and the coach
went on. The shadows deepened under the balcony
and the white light from the windows and
skylight no longer reflected from the shiny floor.
Manager Johnson switched the electricity on. The
clock at the end of the hall indicated twenty minutes
to six. Mr. Cade tossed down the fragment
of chalk and dusted his hands.</p>

<p>“That’s all,” he said. “Eight o’clock
promptly, please.”</p>

<p>They filed out and down the stairs to showers
and street clothes. At six they began to assemble
again at the table for supper. To-night Mr. Cade
was in his place at the end of the board and conversation
was general and cheerful and laughter
frequent. Some of the sixteen fellows who lined
both sides of the long table didn’t laugh; some
scarcely talked; and Russell was of the latter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
number. He was feeling strangely apprehensive.
To-morrow he might—indeed, if he was to believe
some, undoubtedly would—be called on to play
against Kenly Hall, and the realization was decidedly
unnerving. Going up against the first
team was one thing; that held no terrors; but
facing the school enemy, the redoubtable wearers
of the Cherry-and-Black, gave him a sort of sick
feeling in his stomach. There were periods when
he longed for his erstwhile obscurity with all his
heart!</p>

<p>There was an hour or longer of respite after
supper, but it didn’t help Russell much to regain
his courage and peace of mind. The school talked
football incessantly. No other subject was for the
moment acknowledged to exist. Long before it
was time for him to accompany Jimmy to the gymnasium
the fellows were flocking to the Assembly
Hall for the final cheer meeting. Football songs
sounded on all sides. Fellows who couldn’t sing
them, whistled. They just wouldn’t let you forget
for a minute, thought Russell resentfully.</p>

<p>Back in the gymnasium, Mr. Cade and the blackboard
came again into action, but now there was a
veritable “quiz,” and the players were called on
to answer questions that, as it seemed to the new
member of the team, might have floored the inventor
of football himself! Signal practice once
more followed, several plays were again run
through and then “Johnny” put aside his pedagogic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
manner, pushed the blackboard aside and
talked to them very quietly for ten minutes during
which time a dropping pin would have caused
a stampede of alarm. What he said doesn’t matter.
Coaches all say pretty much the same thing
all over this broad land on the eve of the big
battle. But “Johnny” got it across, and grave
faces looked back at him and told him things that
tongues couldn’t have put in words. And then
there was a sudden silence broken at last by Captain
Mart.</p>

<p>“Three cheers for Mr. Cade, fellows!” cried
Mart passionately. “Come on! <em>Come on!</em>”
Then there was a cheer for Alton, and they went
out rather silently and sought their rooms. Overhead
a star-pricked sky promised a fair day for
the supreme test. Russell fell asleep at last just
after midnight had sounded.</p>

<p>Russell was not late for chapel the next morning
only because Stick, in spite of all protests and
pleas, pulled him bodily from bed. The bell was
ringing as they went tumbling down the stairs and
they reached the goal just as the final stroke
sounded. Doctor McPherson, as was his yearly
custom, added to the prayer an intercession for
the football team. “For those of us who do contend
this day in manly sport we pray thy countenance.
If in thy sight they be deserving, give
them, O Lord, strength of soul and of body that
they may attain their goal.”</p>

<p>Breakfast was a melancholy meal, for under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
pretense of merriment and nonchalance lay
dubiety and dread. To Russell it seemed that he
had awakened to a Roman holiday for which he
was cast in the rôle of the Christian Martyr.
After breakfast, with a long two hours ahead of
them, he and Jimmy walked over to the Sign of
the Football. Stick was already busy, for trade
was brisk to-day, and promised to be brisker. The
counter was fairly piled with pennants of Alton
and Kenly colors, with small gray-and-gold megaphones
and with arm-bands of the rival hues.
Russell took his place behind the counter with his
partner and managed to forget for a short time
the impending fate. But after he had made the
wrong change twice he decided to let Stick manage
alone. Jimmy had gone to the back of the
store where Mr. J. Warren Pulsifer seemed unusually
busy and unusually cheerful. Out on the
street again, Jimmy chuckled and, in reply to Russell’s
unspoken question, said:</p>

<p>“Well, J. Warren’s got his release, and the old
boy’s as happy as a lark!”</p>

<p>“His release?” echoed the other.</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s going out of business, Rus. Packing
up right now. Monday you’ll have the place to
yourself.”</p>

<p>“But, how—why—”</p>

<p>“That’s what I wanted to know,” chuckled
Jimmy. “Well, J. Warren says that what happened
Thursday night settled it. Says he thought
it all over carefully and decided that Aunt Mary—or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
whatever her name was—wouldn’t want him
to continue the business after it had become dangerous.
Aunt Mary, he says, was very tender-hearted,
and he knows that she wouldn’t approve
of his getting beaten up merely to keep to the
terms of the will. It sounds sort of weak to me,
but he’s perfectly satisfied with his reasoning, and
he’s the doctor! Funny, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Russell laughed for the first time that day.
“Funny? I should say so!” Then he sobered
suddenly. “Look here, though, Jimmy, that puts
the whole place on us! What about the rent?”</p>

<p>“Well, J. Warren’s lease isn’t up until the first
of the year, so you fellows will have six weeks,
nearly, to look around. But if it was me, I’d take
the whole premises, Rus.”</p>

<p>Russell was thoughtfully silent for several minutes.
Then he nodded resolutely. “That’s what
we’ll do, Jimmy,” he declared. “Something tells
me that the Sign of the Football is going to be a
success. Of course, it will mean nearly twice as
much rent, and we’ll have to sign a lease for a
whole year, but—still—”</p>

<p>“Nothing venture, nothing have,” said Jimmy
gayly. “The store’s going to be a winner, Rus.
Accept that from yours truly. You’ve tied the can
to old Crocker, and he won’t trouble you again,
I’ll bet. From now on you’ll have clear sailing,
old son. Such is the prediction of James W. Austen.
The W, Rus, stands for Wisdom!”</p>

</div>


<p>For nearly an hour Russell had sat, blanketed,
tense of nerves, on the narrow bench on the Alton
side of the field and watched the fortunes of battle.
There had been no scoring. Twice Kenly’s red-stockinged
warriors had threatened the home
team’s goal, once trying a drop-kick from an almost
hopeless distance and once piling up on the
twenty-three yards for three downs and no gain
and then hurling a hit-or-miss forward pass that,
fortunately for the defenders, had missed! Once
Alton had rushed as far as Kenly’s eighteen yards
where an off-side play had spoiled her chance of
scoring. A desperate fake kick, with Harmon taking
the pigskin around left end, had lost the ball
on the nineteen. For the rest of the time the two
teams had edged back and forth across the almost
obliterated fifty-yard line, rushing, passing, punting,
playing somewhat ragged football to be sure,
but playing it very desperately.</p>

<p>Now the Gray-and-Gold was back in the gymnasium,
sore and battle-scarred; weary, too, but
not knowing it. And the minutes were ticking
away fast toward the second half. Manager Johnson,
watch in hand, pale-faced and as nervous as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
a wet hen, walked a sentry beat between the door
and the benches. Coach Cade had said his say,
and he and Captain Proctor and Ned Richards
were conferring soberly together.</p>

<p>“Time’s about up, Coach!” called Johnson.</p>

<p>The group of three broke up. The coach nodded
to the manager and then held up his hand. “Same
line-up,” he announced, “except Longstreth at
right half and Emerson at right end. All right!
You know what to do, fellows! Let’s get them
this time!”</p>

<p>There was a cheer, hoarse, deafening, and then
they crowded eagerly about the door, pushing and
shoving good-naturedly, laughing, pranking, until,
outside, they waited for Mart Proctor to take
the lead. Then they trotted back to the gridiron,
while the long Alton cheer broke forth from the
stand.</p>

<p>Russell, keeping close beside Jimmy, tugged his
sleeve. “Jimmy,” he asked with dry lips,
“Jimmy, did he say me at right end?”</p>

<p>Jimmy turned and laughed at sight of Russell’s
face. “Yes, you lucky dog! For the love of Pete,
don’t look like that, Rus! What’s the matter?”
Jimmy knew, but pretended he didn’t. Russell
grinned crookedly and wet his lips with his tongue.</p>

<p>“I—I’m scared!” he croaked.</p>

<p>“Fine stuff! Hand it on! I’ll be with you
pretty soon, son, and we’ll show those red-legs
how to play football!”</p>

<p>During the first half of the game McLeod had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
played left end and Lake right. Harley had
showed himself just as much at home on the left
of the line as in his accustomed position, but Lake,
first substitute, had not equaled him. Lake had
been boxed far too often, and, once, when he had
missed a tackle almost under Kenly’s goal, the
Cherry-and-Black’s quarter had dodged his way
along the side line to the forty yards before he
had been pulled down by Richards. Coach Cade
had determined to try a new right end for the
third quarter. Perhaps when the fourth period
began Lake would go back again. Meanwhile new
blood might help.</p>

<p>Kenly kicked off and Longstreth captured the
short kick and was brought down with no gain.
From the twenty-eight yards Alton began her
journey. Kenly’s line from guard to guard was
impregnable. That had been already proved. Her
tackles, too, were clever and not easily fooled. In
short, gains through the Kenly line were few and
far between, and Alton had recourse now to end
runs and occasional forward passes. Russell’s
stage-fright lasted through two plays. Then he
forgot to be scared, forgot everything but his
overmastering desire to serve and win. After all,
this was not greatly different from playing
against the first. Those red-legged, red-sleeved
opponents seemed no more in earnest than the
old opponents and played no more desperately.
The big, square-jawed tackle who faced him at
times was no more formidable than Mart Proctor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
had been. In fact, Russell began to think that
Mart was the better of the two, especially after
Ned Richards, with a cunningly concealed ball,
whizzed inside the big tackle for four yards.</p>

<p>Like the first half, the second proved the teams
too evenly weighted and skilled for long gains by
either side. Two yards, three, two yards again,
and then a punt. Sometimes one or the other managed
an end run that brought a larger gain, but
neither team made first down by straight rushing
until the third quarter was almost done. Then
Kenly worked a criss-cross of a pattern as old as
the hills and got seven yards through Stimson,
placing the pigskin on Alton’s thirty-eight. Yet
two minutes later the Gray-and-Gold was again in
possession and Ned Richards’ voice was chanting
his shrill signals.</p>

<p>Back and forth across the middle of the field
went the ball. Penalties for off-side were many.
There were a few for holding. Each team suffered
about equally from these. The quarter came
finally to an end and the rivals drew away and
the ball was taken across the field and deposited
close to the forty-five-yard line. Raleigh and
Mawson trotted on, then Linthicum. But Lake
did not come back. It didn’t occur to Russell to
give consideration to this fact. The whistle blew
again and the lines once more tensed. On the
stands the prospect of a no-score game was already
a favorite topic of discussion. The teams<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
were too well matched for anything short of a
miracle to break the dead-lock. Alton accepted the
likelihood with better grace than Kenly, for Alton,
until a few days since, had looked for defeat, and
anything short of that was to be accepted with
thanksgiving. Kenly, however, knowing of her
ancient rival’s long-continued slump and realizing
her own powers, had come to Alton looking not
only for victory but a decisive and glorious one.
Of the two forces it was Kenly Hall who saw the
time shortening and the game drawing to an inconclusive
end with the less satisfaction.</p>

<p>Once, soon after the last period started, Ned
Richards brought the Alton stand to its feet with a
thirty-yard run that, for one ecstatic moment
seemed to spell a touchdown. But he was spilled
on Kenly’s twenty-four, and, although Alton
chanted lustily for a score, two rushes made no
headway, a forward-pass grounded and Linthicum’s
effort at a drop-kick was a sad performance.
Coach Cade began on his reserves then, and from
that moment new men appeared at short intervals.
Jimmy joined soon after the period started, and
afterwards came Cravath and Johnston and
Smedley and still others.</p>

<p>Russell had long since proved Coach Cade’s wisdom.
Harley McLeod was no more fleet of foot
under kicks than Russell, nor were there more
gains at Russell’s end of the line than at the other.
At tackling Russell showed himself earnest and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
certain, and no Kenly back, having caught the
booted ball, moved after Russell’s arms had
clutched him. He was streaked of face, sore of
muscles, lame of leg, but gloriously happy.</p>

<p>Kenly was becoming almost hysterical now in
her mad efforts to score. Forward-passes that
were on the face of them forlorn hopes sailed
through the air. Twice the Cherry-and-Black almost
made them good, but once Captain Proctor
saved the day and once it was Russell who at the
last moment shouldered the expectant catcher
aside. Alton tried her best to win, but she indulged
in no risky plays. To keep the ball and
get a back away inside or outside tackle was now
her only hope until she could reach a point inside
the enemy’s thirty yards. Once there, she would
try a field-goal. But the backs couldn’t get away,
at least, not far. Kenly watched Harmon, and
subsequently Mawson, as a cat watches a mouse.
So, as through the former periods, the ball remained
well inside the two thirty-five-yard lines
and, so far as scoring was concerned, the game
was already evidently at an end.</p>

<p>The time-keeper announced four minutes, then
two. The stands were emptying. Kenly, who had
risked all on her first-string men until now, began
to hurl new warriors into her army. Every other
moment the pauses were prolonged by the appearances
of hurrying, eager substitutes. The shadows
were deepening about the field and over on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
the Alton stand the hundreds of voices were singing
the spirited pæan that is reserved for victory.
The ball was on Alton’s forty-six yards and it was
the third down. Linthicum took the pass from
Richards and hurled himself at right tackle for
one scant yard. It was fourth down and five to
go now. Jimmy stepped back slowly, held forth
his hands. Four times he had punted far and
true, but this time it was to be different. Cries
of “Hold ’em, Alton!” and cries of “Get through,
Kenly! Block this kick!” broke forth hoarsely.
Then the lines swayed, were torn into fragments.
A Kenly forward hurled himself high in air and
met the kicked ball against his helmet. The pigskin
bounded back up the field toward the Alton
goal. Half a dozen players tried for it and
missed. Then, in the blue haze of twilight, the
watchers saw a figure detach itself from the mêlée
and cut across toward the side line. Shouts of
warning, of joy, of despair floated up from the
field. The scattered forms there, like hounds on
the track of the fox, sped helter-skelter after the
fleeing player. <a href="#image01">Now he was blocked, now he had
broken free again!</a> Past midfield he went, heading
in again toward the center of the trampled expanse.
Friend and foe were about him and his
flight seemed ended a dozen times. Yet always,
by a sudden turn, a wrenching to left or right, a
quick thrust of a straight arm, he managed to
break away. Now he was out of the confusion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
the field was trailing astern. He was passing the
thirty-five yards under flying feet. Between him
and the nearing goal no enemy lurked, for Kenly’s
quarter had been drawn out of position by the
blocked kick. But that quarter was in hot pursuit
a half-dozen strides behind. Back of him the
rest of the players were strung out for many
yards.</p>

<p>The fox faltered once near the twenty, and the
nearer hound lessened the intervening space, but a
third actor had joined them now. Close to the fifteen
yards he made his final desperate effort.
Drawing even with the red-legged pursuer, he
launched himself sidewise. Together the two went
down and rolled over, and the fox ran free! Another
white line passed under his feet, and another.
Bedlam had broken loose on the Alton
stand and that last faint streak was crossed to
the wild exultation of victory! And having
crossed the line, Russell set the ball down and set
himself down beside it. Then he closed his eyes
while the nearer goal-post swayed like the mast of
a vessel in a heavy sea!</p>

<p>It was Jimmy who reached him first, Jimmy
who, panting and exhausted, threw an arm about
his shoulders and rubbed streaming eyes against
a dirty sleeve. “Oh, Rus!” muttered Jimmy.
“Bless your heart, son! We’ve won! Do you get
it, Rus? We’ve won the old ball game!”</p>

<p>The author of this series of exciting flying stories
is an experienced aviator. He says, “During my five
years in the army I performed nearly every sort of
flying duty—instructor, test pilot, bombing, photographing
pilot, etc., in every variety of ship, from tiny
scout planes to the gigantic three-motored Italian
Caproni.”</p>

<p>Not only has this author had many experiences as
a flyer; a list of his activities while knocking around
the country includes postal clerk, hobo, actor, writer,
mutton chop salesman, preacher, roughneck in the oil
fields, newspaper man, flyer, scenario writer in Hollywood
and synthetic clown with the Sells Floto Circus.
Having lived an active, daring life, and possessing a
gift for good story telling, he is well qualified to write
these adventures of a red-blooded dare-devil young
American who became one of the country’s greatest

<p>All readers of the Tom Slade and the Roy Blakeley
books are acquainted with Pee-wee Harris. These stories
record the true facts concerning his size (what there is of
it) and his heroism (such as it is), his voice, his clothes,
his appetite, his friends, his enemies, his victims. Together
with the thrilling narrative of how he foiled, baffled, circumvented
and triumphed over everything and everybody
(except where he failed) and how even when he failed he
succeeded. The whole recorded in a series of screams and
told with neither muffler nor cut-out.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
